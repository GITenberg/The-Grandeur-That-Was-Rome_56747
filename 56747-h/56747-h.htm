<p class="c"><big>THE GLORY THAT WAS GREECE</big><br />
BY J. C. STOBART, M.A.
<br /><br />
SOME OPINIONS OF THE PRESS</p>
<div class="sml85">
<p>“Mr. Stobart does a real service when he gives the reading but
non-expert public this fine volume, embodying the latest results of
research, blending them, too, into as agreeable a narrative as we have
met with for a long while.... There is not a dull line in his book. He
has plenty of humour, as a writer needs must have who is to deal with
men from the human standpoint.... It is beautifully produced, and the
plates, both in colour and monochrome, are as numerous and well-chosen
as they are striking and instructive.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Guardian.</span></p>

<p>“Mr. Stobart has produced the very book to show the modern barbarian the
meaning of Hellenism. He exhibits the latest discoveries from Cnossus
and elsewhere, the new-found masterpieces along with the old. He
criticises and appraises the newest theories, ranging from the influence
of malaria to the origins of drama. He has something for everybody....
The book is nobly illustrated ... no such collection of beautiful things
of this kind has yet been placed before the English public.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">THE
Saturday Review.</span></p>

<p>“He really helps to make ancient Greece a living reality; and the
illustrations, a conspicuous feature of the book, are good and well
selected, the photographic views gaining much from the reproduction on a
dull-surfaced paper.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Times.</span></p>

<p>“A more beautiful book than this has rarely been printed.... The
pictures of Greek scenery, sculpture, vases, etc., are exceptionally
good.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Evening Standard.</span></p>

<p>“No better guide through the labyrinth of things Hellenic has appeared
in our day, and both brush and camera yield of their choicest to make
the book an enduring joy.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Daily Chronicle.</span></p>

<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">This</span> book is a continuation of “The Glory that was Greece,” written with
the same purpose and from the same point of view.</p>

<p>The point of view is that of humanity and the progress of civilisation.
The value of Rome’s contribution to the lasting welfare of mankind is
the test of what is to be emphasised or neglected. Hence the instructed
reader will find a deliberate attempt to adjust the historical balance
which has, I venture to think, been unfairly deflected by excessive
deference to literary and scholastic traditions. The Roman histories of
the nineteenth century were wont to stop short with the Republic,
because “Classical Latin” ceased with Cicero and Ovid. They followed
Livy and Tacitus in regarding the Republic as the hey-day of Roman
greatness, and the Empire as merely a distressing sequel beginning and
ending in tragedy. From the standpoint of civilisation this is an
absurdity. The Republic was a mere preface. The Republic until its last
century did nothing for the world, except to win battles whereby the
road was opened for the subsequent advance of civilisation. Even the
stern tenacity of the Roman defence against Hannibal, admirable as it
was, can only be called superior to the still more heroic defence of
Jerusalem by the Jews, because the former was successful and the latter
failed. From the Republican standpoint Rome is immeasurably inferior to
Athens. In short, what seemed important and glorious to Livy will not
necessarily remain so after the lapse of nearly two thousand years. Rome
is so vast a fact, and of consequences so far-reaching, that every
generation may claim a share in interpreting<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_viii" id="page_viii">{viii}</a></span> her anew. There is the
Rome of the ecclesiastic, of the diplomat, of the politician, of the
soldier, of the economist. There is the Rome of the literary scholar,
and the Rome of the archæologist.</p>

<p>It is wonderful how this mighty and eternal city varies with her various
historians. Diodorus of Sicily, to whom we owe most of her early
history, was seeking mainly to flatter the claims of the Romans to a
heroic past. Polybius, the trained Greek politician of the second
century <small>B.C.</small>, was writing Roman history in order to prove to his
fellow-Greeks his theory of the basis of political success. Livy was
seeking a solace for the miseries of his own day in contemplating the
virtues of an idealised past. Tacitus, during an interval of mitigated
despotism, strove to exhibit the crimes and follies of autocracy. These
were both rhetoricians, trained in the school of Greek democratic
oratory. Edward Gibbon, too (I write as one who cannot change trains at
Lausanne without emotion), saw the Empire from the standpoint of
eighteenth-century liberalism and materialism. Theodor Mommsen made Rome
the setting for his Bismarckian Cæsarism, and finally, M. Boissier has
enlivened her by peopling her streets with Parisians. It is, in fact,
difficult to depict so huge a landscape without taking and revealing an
individual point of view. There is always something fresh to see even in
the much-thumbed records of Rome.</p>

<p>Although a large part of this book is written directly from the original
sources, and none of it without frequent reference to them, it is, in
the main, frankly a derivative history intended for readers who are not
specialists. Except Pelham’s <i>Outlines</i>, which are almost exclusively
political, there is no other book in English, so far as I am aware,
which attempts to give a view of the whole course of ancient Roman
History within the limits of a single volume, and yet the Empire without
the Republic is almost as incomplete as the Republic without the Empire.
As for the Empire, although nothing can supersede or attempt to replace
<i>The Decline and Fall</i>, yet the schola<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_ix" id="page_ix">{ix}</a></span>r’s outlook on the history of the
Empire has been greatly changed since Gibbon’s day by the discovery of
Pompeii and the study of inscriptions. Therefore while I fully admit my
obligations to Gibbon and Mommsen (as well as to Dill, Pelham, Bury,
Haverfield, Greenidge, Warde Fowler, Cruttwell, Sellar, Walters, Rice
Holmes, and Mrs. Strong, and to Ferrero, Pais, Boissier, Seeck,
Bernheim, Mau, Becker, and Friedlander) this book professes to be
something more than a compilation, because it has a point of view of its
own.</p>

<p>The pictures are an integral part of my scheme. It is not possible with
Rome, as it was with Greece, to let pictures and statues take the place
of wars and treaties. Wars and treaties are an essential part of the
Grandeur of Rome. They should have a larger place here, were they less
well known, and were there less need to redress a balance. But the
pictures are chosen so that the reader’s eye may be able to gather its
own impression of the Roman genius. When the Roman took pen in hand he
was usually more than half a Greek, but sometimes in his handling of
bricks and mortar he revealed himself. For this reason&mdash;and because I
must confess not to be a convinced admirer of “Roman Art”&mdash;there is an
attempt to make the illustrations convey an impression of grand
building, vast, solid, and utilitarian, rather than of finished
sculpture by Greek hands. Pictures can produce this impression far more
powerfully than words. Standing in the Colosseum or before the solid
masonry of the Porta Nigra at Trier, one has seemed to come far closer
to the heart of the essential Roman than ever in reading Vergil or
Horace. The best Roman portraits are strangely illuminating.</p>

<p>I have to acknowledge with gratitude the permission given me by the
Director of the Königlichen Messbildanstalt of the Royal Museum at
Berlin to reproduce four of the magnificent photographs of Dr. O.
Puchstein’s discoveries at Ba’albek. I am indebted also to Herr Georg
Reimer, of Berlin, for allowing me to reproduce four of the complete
series of Reliefs from Trajan’s Column published by him in heliogravure
under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_x" id="page_x">{x}</a></span> care of Professor Cichorius. The coloured plate of the
interior of the House of Livia is reproduced by permission of the German
Archæological Institute from Luckenbach’s <i>Kunst und Geschichte</i> (grosse
Ausgabe, erster Teil); and from the same work I have been allowed to
reproduce the reconstruction of the Roman Forum in the time of Cæsar.
Professor Garstang has kindly supplied a photograph, with permission to
reproduce of the bronze head of Augustus discovered by him at Meroe and
recently presented to the British Museum. The Cambridge University Press
has allowed me to give two pictures from Prof. Ridgeway’s <i>Early Age of
Greece</i>; and the photograph of the Alcántara Bridge was kindly supplied
by Sr. D. Miguel Utrillo, of Barcelona. The majority of photographs have
been supplied by Messrs. W. A. Mansell and Co.; but for many subjects,
especially of Roman remains outside Italy, I must acknowledge my
indebtedness to a number of amateur photographers, who not only avoid
the hackneyed point of view but also achieve a high level of technique.
Sir Alexander Binnie has kindly permitted the inclusion of eight
photographs and Mr. C. T. Carr of four; while I must also make
acknowledgment to Miss Carr, Mr. R. C. Smith, and Miss K. P. Blair.</p>

<p>As before, I am much indebted to Mr. Arnold Gomme for his assistance
with the proofs.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Perspective of Roman History</span></h3>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">
<img src="images/cap1.png"

alt="A"
/></span>THENS and Rome stand side by side as the parents of Western
civilisation. The parental metaphor is almost irresistible. Rome is so
obviously masculine and robust, Greece endowed with so much loveliness
and charm. Rome subjugates by physical conquest and government. Greece
yields so easily to the Roman might and then in revenge so easily
dominates Rome itself, with all that Rome has conquered, by the mere
attractiveness of superior humanity. Nevertheless this metaphor of
masculine and feminine contains a serious fallacy. Greece, too, had had
days of military vigour. It was by superior courage and skill in
fighting that Athens and Sparta had beaten back the Persian invasions of
the fifth century before Christ, and thus saved Europe for
occidentalism. Again it was by military prowess that Alexander the Great
carried Greek civilisation to the borders of India, Hellenising Asia
Minor, Syria, Persia, Egypt, Phœnicia and even Palestine. This he did
just at the moment when Rome was<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_2" id="page_2">{2}</a></span> winning her dominion over Latium.
Instead, then, of looking at Greece and Rome as two coeval forces
working side by side we must regard them as predecessor and successor.
Rome is scarcely revealed as a world-power until she meets Greek
civilisation in Campania near the beginning of the third century before
Christ. The physical decline of Greece is scarcely apparent until her
phalanx returns beaten in battle by the Roman maniples at Beneventum.
Moreover, in addition to this chronological division of spheres there is
also a geographical division. Greece takes the East, Rome the West, and
though by the time that Rome went forth to govern her Western provinces
she was already pretty thoroughly permeated with Greek civilisation, yet
the West remained throughout mediæval history far more Latin than Greek.
When Constantine divided the empire he was only expressing in outward
form a natural division of culture.</p>

<p>The resemblances between Rome and Greece even from the first are very
clearly marked. In many respects they are visibly of the same family,
and, though we no longer speak as confidently of “Aryan” and
“Indo-European” as did the ethnologists and philologists of the
nineteenth century, yet there remains an obvious kinship of language,
customs, and even dress. Many of the most obvious similarities, such as
those of religion, are now seen to be the result of later borrowing, but
there remains a distinct cousinship, whether derived from the conquest
of both peninsulas by kindred tribes of northern invaders, as Ridgeway
holds, or from the existence of an aboriginal Mediterranean face, as
Sergi believes&mdash;or from both.</p>

<p>But with all these resemblances, one of the most interesting features of
ancient history lies in the psychological contrast between Greece and
Rome, or rather between Athens and Rome. Athens is rich in ideas, full
of the spirit of inquiry, and hence fertile in invention, fond of
novelty, worshipping brilliance of mind and body. Rome is stolid and
conservative, devoted to tradition and law. Gravity and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_3" id="page_3">{3}</a></span> the sense of
duty are her supreme virtues. Here we have the two types that succeed
and conquer, set side by side for comparison. To which is the victory in
the end?</p>

<p>To the Englishman of to-day Rome is in some ways far more familiar than
Greece. Apart from obvious resemblances in history and in character,
Rome touches our own domestic history, and any man who has marked the
stability of old Roman foundations or the straightness of old Roman
roads has already grasped a fundamental truth about her. He is surely
not far wrong in the general sense of irresistible power, of blind
energy and rigid law, which he associates with the name of Rome. Thus,
there is not as there was in the case of Greece any radical
misconception of the Roman character to be combated.</p>

<p>But there is, it appears, a widely prevalent false perspective in the
common view of Roman history. The modern reader, especially if he be an
Englishman, is a very stern moralist in his judgment of other nations
and ages. In addition to this he is a citizen of an empire now extremely
self-conscious and somewhat bewildered at its own magnitude. He cannot
help drawing analogies from Roman history and seeking in it “morals” for
his own guidance. The Roman empire bears such an obvious and unique
resemblance to the British that the fate of the former must be of
enormous interest to the latter. For this reason alone we are apt to
regard the <i>fall</i> of Rome as the cardinal point of Roman history. To
this must be added the influence of Gibbon’s great work. By Gibbon we
are led to contemplate above all things (with Silas Wegg) her Decline
and Fall. Thus Rome has become for many people simply a colossal failure
and a horrible warning. We behold her first as a Republic tottering to
her inevitable ruin, and then as an Empire decaying from the start and
continuing to fester for some five hundred years. This is one of the
cases which prove that History is made not so much by heroes or natural
forces as by historians. It is an accident of historiography<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_4" id="page_4">{4}</a></span> that the
Republic was not described by any great native historian until its
close, when amid the horrors of civil war men set themselves to idealise
the heroes of extreme antiquity and thus left a gloomy picture of
unmitigated deterioration. As there was no great historian in sympathy
with the imperial regime, the reputation of the early Empire was left
mainly in the hands of Tacitus and Suetonius, the former of whom riddled
it with epigrams while the latter befouled it with scandal. Nearly all
Roman writers had a rhetorical training and a satirical bent: all Romans
were praisers of the past. Thus it is that Roman virtue has receded into
an age which modern criticism declares to be mythological. It is a
further accident that the genius of Rome’s greatest modern historian was
also strongly satirical. It was a natural affinity of temper which led
Gibbon to continue the story of Tacitus and to dip his pen into the same
bitter fluid.</p>

<p>Thus Rome has found few impartial historians and hardly any sympathetic
ones. But is it possible to be sympathetic? While every true scholar
feels a thrill at the name of Greece, scarcely any one <i>loves</i> Ancient
Rome. At the first mention of her name the average man’s thoughts fly to
the Colosseum and the Christian martyr “facing the lion’s gory mane” to
the music of Nero’s fiddle. His second thought is to formulate his
explanation of her decline and fall. The explanations are as various as
political complexions. “Luxury,” says the moralist, “Heathendom,” says
the Christian, “Christianity,” replies Gibbon. The Protectionist can
easily show that it was due to the Importation of free corn, while the
Free Trader draws attention to the enormous burdens which Roman trade
had to bear. “Militarism,” explains the peace-lover; “neglect of
personal service,” replies the conscriptionist. The Liberal and the
Conservative can both draw valuable conclusions from Roman history in
support of their respective attitudes of mind. “If it had not been for
demagogues like Marius and the Gracchi,” says the Conservative, “Rome
might have continued to exhibit the courage and patriotism<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_5" id="page_5">{5}</a></span> which she
displayed under senatorial guidance in the war against Hannibal, instead
of rushing to her doom by way of sedition and disorder.” With equal
justice the Liberal points to the stupid bigotry with which that corrupt
oligarchy, the senate, delayed necessary reforms. That, he says, was the
cause of the downfall of Rome. That was the writing on the wall.</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Plate</span> I. GENERAL VIEW OF ROMAN FORUM</p></div>
</div>

<p>Whether it is or is not possible to love Ancient Rome, I would suggest
that this attitude of treating her merely as a subject for autopsies and
a source of gloomy vaticinations for the benefit of the British Empire
is a preposterous affront to history. The mere notion of an empire
continuing to decline and fall for five centuries is ridiculous. It is
to regard as a failure the greatest civilising force in all the history
of Europe, the most stable form of government, the strongest military
and political system that has ever existed.</p>

<p>It is just at this point that our own generation can add something of
great importance to the study of Roman history. Whatever may be said for
its faith, hope is the great discovery of our age. By the help of that
blessed word “Evolution” we have learnt not to put our Golden Ages in
the past but in the future. In many instances we have discovered that
what our fathers called decay was really progress. May it not be so with
Rome?</p>

<p>The destiny or function of Rome in world-history was nothing more or
less than the making of Europe. The modern family of European nations
are her sons and daughters, and some of her daughters have grown up and
married foreign husbands and given birth to offspring. For this great
purpose it was necessary that the city itself should pass through the
phases of growth, maturity and decay. In political terms, it was part of
the Roman destiny to translate the civilisation of the city-state into
that of the nation or territorial state. Having evolved the Province it
was necessary that the City should expire. Conquest on a colossal scale
was part of the programme, absolute centralised<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_6" id="page_6">{6}</a></span> dominion was another
part. For this purpose the change from republic to autocracy was
necessary.</p>

</div>

<p>Greece, as we have seen elsewhere, by her system of small states
enclosed and protected by city walls, had been able, long before the
world at large was nearly ripe for it, to develop a civilised culture
with habits of thought and speech which are now called European or
Occidental. It was in a highly concentrated social life and under
artificial conditions that Athens had laid the foundation of all our
arts, sciences and philosophies. It was, however, as we saw, impossible
for the civic democracy to expand naturally. She could hold a little
empire for a few years by means of precarious sea-power. She could throw
off a few daughter cities made in her own likeness. But for missionary
work on a large scale the city-state was not adapted. Something much
larger than a city and much more single-minded than a democracy was
necessary for that purpose. The genius of Alexander the Great, an
autocrat and a semi-barbarian, enabled him to do much towards
propagating Hellenism in the eastern part of the Mediterranean littoral.
But his early death prevented the fulfilment of his task and the half of
him that was Greek made him consider the planting of new Greek cities
the only means for fulfilling it.</p>

<p>Here then was the part which Rome had to play. She had to do for the
West what Alexander had attempted for the East. In some respects her
task was harder, for her work lay among warlike barbarians, but easier
in that she had not to face the corrupting influence of a rival and more
ancient civilisation.</p>

<p>Rome too began as a city-state and it was while she was still in that
condition that Greek civilisation came to her and took her by storm. It
was the new wine that burst the old bottle when Rome attempted to
transform herself into a Greek democracy, and failing became a monarchy
once more. It was not, therefore, a case of “decline and fall” when Rome
ceased to be a republic. No liberal need heave a sigh for the departed
republic. It was an oligarchy that had for a century<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_7" id="page_7">{7}</a></span> deserved to be
replaced by something better, and the change was even an upward step in
liberty for all but a few hundreds of Roman nobles. If we can but turn
our minds away from the gossip of the court and the spite of the
discontented aristocracy to a just survey of that majestic and enduring
system of provincial government, we shall be able to discern progress
where historians would have us lament decay.</p>

<p>It was progress again when Rome gradually ceased to be a city-state with
a surrounding territory and became successively the capital of an empire
and then one of half a dozen great centres of government. Finally it was
progress, as we ought by now to be able to see, when the artificial
ramparts on the Rhine and Danube broke down and the new nations came
into their inheritance. By that time Rome had accomplished her work and
the phase of the city-state was over.</p>

<p>Some such convictions as these are, I think, inevitable to any one who
views European history as a whole in the light of any theory of
historical evolution. Rome has long been the playground of satirists and
pessimists. Unfortunately at this date it is difficult if not impossible
to shake their verdict and to read Roman history in the new light. To do
so you cannot follow the authorities, for they were all on the side of
deterioration. The idea of progress was unknown to the ancient world,
and above all others the Romans believed that their Golden Age was
behind them. It becomes necessary therefore to extract truth from
unwilling witnesses, always a precarious and suspicious undertaking. All
the Roman men of letters believed with Horace:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">damnosa quid non imminuit dies?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">ætas parentum peior auis tulit<br /></span>
<span class="i2">nos nequiores, mox daturos<br /></span>

</div>

<p class="nind">Unless we are prepared to accept the rank of <i>progenies vitiosissima</i> we
are compelled to discount this whole tendency of thought and read our
authorities between the lines. They were all rhetoricians, all bent on
praising the past at the expense of the present and the future; none of
them were over-scrupulous in dealing with evidence. If all the
historians had perished and only the inscriptions remained we should
have a very different picture of the Roman empire, a picture much
brighter and, I think, much more faithful to truth.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Latinism</span></h3>

<p>Hellenism we know and understand; every true classical scholar is a
Hellenist by conviction. But what is Latinism and who are our Latinists?
The altar fires are extinct and the votaries are scattered. Except for a
small volume of the choicest Latin poetry of the Augustan age, what that
is Latin gives us pleasure to-day? Greek studies seem to attract all
that is most brilliant and genial in the world of scholarship: Latin is
mainly relegated to the dry-as-dusts. Who reads Lucan out of school
hours? Who would search Egypt for Cicero’s lost work “De Gloria”? Who
would recognise a quotation from Statius?</p>

<p>It has not always been so. Once they quoted Lucan and Seneca across the
floor of the House of Commons. The eighteenth century was far more in
sympathy with Ancient Rome than we are. In those days it would not have
seemed absurd to argue the superiority of Vergil over Homer. Down to
that day Latin had remained the alternative language for educated
people, the medium of international communication, even for diplomacy,
until French gradually took its place. Only if you specifically sought
to reach the vulgar did you write in English. Though Dr. Johnson could
write a very pretty letter in French, he used habitually to converse
with Frenchmen in Latin; not that it made him more intelligible, for, in
fact, no foreigner could understand the English pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_9" id="page_9">{9}</a></span>nunciation of Latin;
but that he did not wish to appear at a disadvantage with a mere
Frenchman by adopting a foreign jargon. As for public inscriptions,
though half the literary men in London signed a round-robin entreating
the great autocrat to write Oliver Goldsmith’s epitaph in English,
Johnson “refused to disgrace the walls of Westminster Abbey with an
English inscription.”</p>

<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Plate</span> III. VIEW OF SPOLETO </p></div>
</div>

<p>What is the cause of the eclipse which Latin studies are still
suffering? One cause, perhaps, is to be found in the misuse of the
language by the pedagogues and philologists of the past in the school
and the examination-room. But another cause is the recent discovery of
the true Greek civilisation, whereby scholars have come to realise that
Latin culture is in the main only secondary and derivative. At the
present moment we are passing through a stage of revolt against
classicism, convention, and artificiality. We know that Greek culture,
truly discerned, is neither “classic” nor conventional nor artificial,
but Latinism is still apparently subject to all these terms. The
Latinity of Cicero, Vergil, Ovid, Horace, Lucan, and the greater part of
the giants, in fact all the Latin of our schools is&mdash;what Greek is
not&mdash;really and truly classical. They were not writing as they spoke and
thought. They had studied the laws of expression in the school of
rhetoric, and on pain of being esteemed barbarous they wrote under those
laws. Style was their aim. Their very language was subject to arbitrary
laws of syntax and grammar. The English schoolboy who approaches Cicero
by way of the primer’s rules and examples is entering into Latin
literature by much the same road as the Romans themselves. The Romans
were grammarians by instinct and orators by education. Thus Latin is
fitted by nature for schoolroom use, and for all who would learn and
study words, which after all are thoughts, Latin is the supremely best
training-ground. The language marches by rule. Rules govern the
inflexions and the concords of the words. The periods are built up
logically and beautifully in obedience to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_10" id="page_10">{10}</a></span> law. Latin, of all languages,
least permits translation. You have only to translate Cicero to despise
him.</p>

<p>In the world of letters, as in that of politics, there are the virtues
of order and the virtues of liberty. Our own eighteenth century was
logical in mind because it had to clothe its thoughts in a language of
precision. But even Pope and Addison are rude barbarians compared with
Vergil and Cicero. <i>De gustibus non est disputandum</i>&mdash;let some prefer
the plain roast and others the made dish. Latin may be an acquired
taste, but no sort of excellence is mortal. Latin will come into its own
again along with Dryden and Congreve, along with patches and periwigs.
Meanwhile it must be a very dull soul who is unmoved by the grandeur of
Roman history, the triumphant march of the citizen legions, the dogged
patriotism which resisted Hannibal to the death, and the pageantry and
splendour of the Empire. One must be blind not to admire the massive
strength of her ruined monuments, arches, bridges, roads, and aqueducts.
And one must be deaf indeed not to enjoy the surges of Ciceronian
oratory or the rolling music of the Vergilian hexameter. Greece may
claim all the charm of the spring-time of civilisation, but Rome in all
her works has a majesty which must command, if not love, wonder and
respect. Mommsen justly remarks that “it is only a pitiful
narrow-mindedness that will object to the Athenian that he did not know
how to mould his State like the Fabii and Valerii, or to the Roman that
he did not learn to carve like Phidias and to write like Aristophanes.”</p>

<p>Under the flowing toga of Latinism the natural Roman is concealed from
our view. It is possible that the progress of research and excavation
may to some extent rediscover him and distinguish him, as it has already
done for his Hellenic brother, from the polished courtiers of the
Augustan age who have hitherto passed as typical products of Rome.</p>

<p>It is astonishing how little we really know of Rome and the Romans after
all that has been said and written about<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_11" id="page_11">{11}</a></span> them. The ordinary natural
Roman is a complete stranger to us. It is certain that he did not live
in luxury like Mæcenas, but how did he live and what sort of man was he?
We can discern that his language was not in the least like that of
Cicero. It appears that he neither dreaded nor disliked emperors like
Nero, as did Tacitus and Juvenal. As for his religion, much has already
been done, and more still remains to be done, to show that he did not
really worship the Hellenised Olympians who pass in literature for his
gods. Recent scholarship has done something to reveal to us the presence
of a real national art in Rome, or at any rate of an artistic
development on Italian soil which made visible steps of its own out of
Hellenic leading-strings. Thus there is some hope that the real Roman
will not always elude us. But for the present in the whole domain of
art, religion, thought, and literature, Greek influence has almost
obliterated the native strain. For the present, therefore, we must be
content to regard Roman civilisation as mainly derivative, and our
principal object will be to see how Rome fulfilled her task as the
missionary of Greek thought. This object, together with the
unsatisfactory nature of the records, must excuse the haste with which I
have passed over the earlier stages of Roman republican history. It is
obvious that the first three centuries of our era will be the important
part of Roman history from this point of view. Also, if the progress of
civilisation be our main study, nothing in Roman history before the
beginning of the second century <small>B.C.</small> can come directly under our
attention. When the Romans first came into contact with the Greeks they
were still barbarians, with no literature, no art, and very little
industry or commerce. The earlier periods will only be introductory.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Italy and the Roman</span></h3>

<p>The pleasant land of Italy needs no description here. Our
illustrations<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> will recall its sunny hill-sides, its deep<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_12" id="page_12">{12}</a></span> shadows,
its vineyards and olive-yards. But there are one or two features of its
geography which have a bearing upon the history of Rome.</p>

<p>To begin with, the geographical unity of the Italian peninsula is more
apparent than real. The curving formation of the Apennines really
divides Italy into four parts&mdash;(1) the northern region, mainly
consisting of the Po valley, a fertile plain which throughout the
Republican period was scarcely considered as part of Italy at all, and
was, in fact, inhabited by barbarian Gauls; (2) the long eastern strip
of Adriatic coast, an exposed waterless and harbourless region, with a
scanty population, which hardly comes into ancient history; (3) the
southern region of Italy proper, hot, fertile, and rich in natural
harbours, so that it very early attracted the notice of the Greek
mariners, and was planted with luxurious and populous cities long before
Rome came into prominence; and (4) the central plain facing westward, in
which the river Tiber and the city of Rome occupy a central position.
Etruria and Latium together fill the greater part of it. Its width is
only about eighty miles, so that there is no room for any considerable
rivers to develop, and, in fact, there are only four rivers of any
importance in a coast-line of more than 300 miles. We may call the whole
of this region a plain in distinction from the Apennine highlands; but
it is, of course, plentifully scattered with hills high enough to
provide an impregnable citadel, and to this day crowned with huddled
villages.</p>

<p>Rome herself on her Seven Hills began her career by securing dominion
over the Latin plain which surrounded her on all sides but the north.
The Roman Campagna,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> which is now desolate and fever-stricken, was
once all populous farmland. The river Tiber, though its silting mouth
and tideless waters now render it useless for navigation, was in the
flourishing days of Ancient Rome navigable for small vessels and Ostia
was a good artificial harbour at its mouth. Thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_13" id="page_13">{13}</a></span> it is history rather
than geography which has made Rome into an unproductive capital. We may
conclude that geography has placed Rome in a favourable position for
securing the control of the Mediterranean and especially of the western
part of it.</p>

<p>It is worth while also to notice the neighbours by whom she was
surrounded when she first struggled forward into the light. Just across
the Tiber to the north of her were the Etruscans of whom we shall see
more in the next chapter. Their pirate ships scoured the sea while their
merchants did business with the Greeks of Sicily, Magna Græcia and
Massilia. It was perhaps her position at the <i>tête du pont</i> that led to
Rome’s early prominence in war. Across the water on the coast of Africa
was the dreaded city of Carthage, which had for centuries been striving
to establish itself on the island of Sicily. All these were seafaring,
commercial peoples, but it was not by sea that Rome met them. Behind
Rome, among the valleys and on the spurs of the Apennines, were a whole
series of sturdy highland clans who like all highlanders noticed the
superior fatness of the valley sheep. It was against these Umbrians,
Marsians, Pelignians, Sabines, and Samnites that the cities of the plain
were constantly at feud, and it was mainly her struggles with these that
kept the Roman swords bright in early days.</p>

<p>As to the Romans themselves and their origin there is little that we can
say for certain. Ancient ethnology is not by any means yet secure of its
premises. One thing is clear enough, if we can place any reliance
whatever upon literary records&mdash;the national characteristics of the
ancient Roman were very unlike those of the modern Italian. The one was
bold, hardy, grave, orderly and inartistic: the other is sensitive,
vivacious, artistic, turbulent and quick-witted. There is not a feature
in common between them and yet the modern Italian is surely the normal
South European type. As you go southwards through France you find the
people approaching these characteristics more and more. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_14" id="page_14">{14}</a></span> Spaniard
and the Greek share them. The Ancient Roman of republican days, unless
he is a literary invention, is assuredly no southerner in temperament,
though the southern qualities undoubtedly begin to grow clear as Roman
history progresses. And then the whole of early Roman history is marked
by a strife between the two orders Patrician and Plebeian, which is
certainly not simply a struggle between two political parties, nor a
mere conflict between rich and poor. There is a division between the two
of religion and custom in such matters as burial, for example, and
marriage-rites. The patricians fear contamination of their blood if the
plebeians are allowed to intermarry with them. These considerations and
others like them have led Prof. Ridgeway to formulate for Rome, as he
has already done with success for Greece, a theory of northern invasion
and conquest in very early days. Probably it is a theory which can never
be proved nor disproved, so woefully scanty is our evidence for the
earliest centuries of Roman history. But it explains the great riddle of
Roman character as no other theory does.</p>

<p>The archæology of the spade does not help us much though it has made
some interesting discoveries on the soil of Italy. There is of course at
the base a Neolithic culture resembling that of the rest of Europe. Then
there is a phase of pile-dwellings widely spread among the marshes of
the Lombard plain called the “Terramare” civilisation. As this phase
belongs to the bronze age we may infer that civilisation developed later
in Italy than in Greece owing to the lack of fortified cities. In this
Terramare period the dead were carefully buried whole, often folded up
into a sitting posture to fit their contracted graves. Then comes an
Early Iron period, called “The Villanova,” where the cremated ashes of
the dead are collected in urns and deposited in vaults generally walled
with flat slabs of stone. Above these two stages come Etruscan and
Gallic remains and then those of the Rome of history. It is probable
enough that the Iron Age of the Villanova culture repre<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_15" id="page_15">{15}</a></span>sents a conquest
from the north. It is likely that in prehistoric times Italy experienced
the same fate as throughout the ages of history. The Alpine passes are
easier from north to south than in the reverse direction, and the
smiling plains of North Italy have always possessed an irresistible
attraction for the barbarian who looks down upon them from those barren
snow-clad heights. Whether the invader be an Umbrian or Gaulish or
Gothic or Austrian warrior, Italia must pay the price for her “fatal
gift of beauty.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_16" id="page_16">{16}</a></span>”</p>

/></span>HAT Rome was not built in a day is the only thing we really know about
the origin of Rome. There is, however, nothing to prevent us from
guessing. The modern historian of the Economic School would picture to
us a limited company of primeval men of business roaming about the world
until they found a spot in the centre of the Mediterranean, a convenient
depot alike for Spanish copper and Syrian frankincense, handy for
commerce with the Etruscans of the north, the Sicilian Greeks of the
south, and the Carthaginians of the African coast. They select a piece
of rising ground on the banks of the river Tiber, about fifteen miles
from its mouth, a spot safe and convenient for their cargo-boats, and
there they build an Exchange, found a Chamber of Commerce (which they
quaintly term <i>senatus</i>), and institute that form of public insurance
which is known as “an army.” Thus equipped they proceed by force or
fraud to acquire a number of markets, to which in due course they give
the name of “Empire.”</p>

<p>This picture, being modern, is naturally impressionistic and rather
vague in its details. From all accounts a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_17" id="page_17">{17}</a></span> deal of engineering
would be required to make the natural Tiber suitable for navigation on a
large scale. Not only does its mouth silt up every year and its channel
constantly change, but just between the hills on the very floor of Rome
every spring made pools and swamps. Nor is there any tide in the
Mediterranean to help the rowers up to the city against the stream. The
Etruscans, who diversified their commercial operations with systematic
piracy, held almost the whole of this western coast in subjection. The
Greeks of the south, who have plenty to say about Etruscan and
Carthaginian seafarers, have forgotten to mention their early Roman
customers. But perhaps that is because the primeval trader from Rome
cannot have had anything much to sell, and certainly had no money at all
to buy with. In founding his Bourse he seems to have forgotten to
provide a Mint; at any rate, long after the Sicilian Greeks had evolved
a most exquisite coinage of silver and gold, the Romans were still
content with the huge and clumsy copper <i>as</i>. I think we may confidently
dismiss external trade from among the causes of the early rise of Rome.
The coinage is the surest evidence we possess, no foreign trade could
have passed in the Mediterranean on a basis of the copper <i>as</i>, and in
Latin the equivalent for “money” is a word denoting “cattle.” Whoever
the early Romans were, they were mainly, as all their religion and
traditions show, land-soldiers and farmers.</p>

<p>Livy takes a more sensible view. He admits that the current accounts of
the foundation of the city are involved in mystery and miracle, but he
asserts with justice that if any city deserved a miraculous origin Rome
did. Thereupon he proceeds to relate the pleasant tale of her foundation
in the year 753 <small>B.C.</small> by Romulus and Remus.</p>

<p>It is surely unprofitable to search very deeply for grains of truth in
the sands of legend which cover the early traditions of Rome, but it is
sometimes interesting to conjecture how and why the legends were
invented. The story of Romulus and Remus, for example, may have taken
its rise in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_18" id="page_18">{18}</a></span></p>

<p>“sacristan’s tale” about an ancient work of art representing a wolf
suckling two babes. A fairly ancient copy of this motive is preserved in
the famous Capitoline Wolf.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> The<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_19" id="page_19">{19}</a></span> wolf at least is ancient, and the
children have been added in modern times from representations of the
famous group on ancient coins. It is possible that the original statue
may go back to days of totemistic religion when the wolf was the
ancestor of a Roman clan.</p>

<p>The Seven Kings of Rome are for the most part mere names which have been
fitted by rationalising antiquarians, presumably Greek, with inventions
appropriate to them. Romulus is simply the patron hero of Rome called by
her name. Numa, the second, whose name suggests <i>numen</i>, was the
blameless Sabine who originated most of the old Roman cults, and
received a complete biography largely borrowed from that invented for
Solon. Tullus Hostilius and Ancus Martius were the <i>hostile</i> and
<i>martial</i> inventors of military systems. Servius Tullius was a man of
<i>servile</i> origin, and on this foundation Freeman built his belief that
the Roman kingship was a career open to talent!</p>

<p>As for the two Tarquins, the latter of whom was turned by Greek
historians into a typical Greek tyrant and made the subject of an
edifying Greek story of tyrannicide closely modelled on the story of
Harmodius, their names are said to be Etruscan. There is a recent theory
that the saving of Rome by Horatius and his comrades is fable designed
to conceal the real conquest of Rome by the Etruscans. As a matter of
fact there is a good deal of other evidence for that theory: reluctant
admissions in history and literature, records of an ancient treaty of
submission, the fact that the ritual and ornament of supreme authority
at Rome seems to be of Etruscan origin, and above all the evidence of
the stones. There are traces of very early skill and activity in
building at Rome, and, unless the Romans afterwards declined very
remarkably in the arts and crafts, their early works, such as the walls
and some of the sewers, must have been built under foreign influence.
That some sort of early kingship at Rome is more than a legend is
certain; the whole fabric of the Roman constitution and its fundamental
theory of <i>imperium</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_20" id="page_20">{20}</a></span> imply the existence of primeval kingship. On the
whole, then, we may well believe that at some early period the city of
Rome under Etruscan princes formed part of an empire which embraced a
number of ports and towns up and down the Italian coast, though it did
not necessarily concern itself with the intervening and surrounding
territories. During all the early centuries of Rome it must have been a
constant struggle between civilised walled towns on or near the coast
and warlike hill tribes, quite uncivilised, from the mountainous
interior.</p>

<p>These mysterious Etruscans have formed the theme of an internecine war
of monographs. On the whole we may pronounce that those scholars who
maintain their Lydian origin have completely demolished the arguments of
those who aver that they sprang from the Rhætian Alps&mdash;and <i>vice versâ</i>.
It remains possible, therefore, that the Etruscans came from nowhere in
particular but were as aboriginal and autochthonous as any European
people. It is true that we cannot make out much of their language, but
that is also true of the aboriginal Cretans&mdash;and of many other
autochthonous peoples. Their earliest remains are of a type familiar to
us in the earliest strata of production all over the Mediterranean
coast-lands&mdash;prehistoric polygonal masonry, a beehive tomb, incised
<i>bucchero nero</i> vases and so forth. Their later and finer work shows a
distinct cousinship with that of Greece though sometimes curiously
debased and uncouth in spirit. In bronze-working they were very
skilful.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> They developed painting to a high pitch in early times, and
the British Museum possesses some interesting examples from Cære. It was
indeed believed by Pliny that Corinthian painters had settled in
Etruria, that being the usual account by which the ancients explained

Their plastic work was mostly in terra-cotta, for the native marbles do
not seem to have been quarried. Some of their terra-cotta coffins,

a superstitious and cruel race. It was from them that the Romans learnt
their bloody craft of divination by the inspection of the entrails of
newly slain victims, and there is little doubt that the victims had not

<p class="nind">or purple stripes, the toga with purple border, the sceptre of ivory,
the curule chair, the twelve lictors with their axes in bundles of
rods&mdash;were borrowed from the Etruscans. Thus it seems that the ancient
garb of the Roman citizen, a tunic covered by a long mantle or toga, a
costume which is essentially the same as the <i>chiton</i> and <i>himation</i> of
the Greeks, started as a fashion introduced by their more civilised
northern neighbours. It seems clear also that the earliest Roman art,
the decoration of temples with painted terra-cotta ornaments, was
Etruscan in origin. Some of the earliest statues of the gods seem to
have been painted, for we hear of a very ancient red Jupiter. Thus there
is some probability that Rome passed through a period, perhaps in the
sixth century, of alien rule and alien civilisation. Remembering the
cousinship between Greece and Etruria we shall find that Rome had been
prepared for the reception of Greek culture in very early times.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_23" id="page_23">{23}</a></span></p>

<p>The fifth century seems to have been a period of decline for the
Etruscan power. The Greek republics, with, as I hope we agreed, their
northern stiffening, had advanced far beyond their Etruscan kinsmen in
intelligence, and the tyrant Hiero of Syracuse defeated them in a great
sea-fight in 474 <small>B.C.</small> It is agreeable to the historian to have a fact so
certain and a date so well attested in all the wilderness of legend that
surrounds the early history of Italy. Then the warlike hill tribes of
the Southern Apennines began to press upon their southern colonies, and
finally the Gauls from the north swept down upon Etruria at the
beginning of the fourth century and broke up their declining empire for
ever. It was probably during this period that the Romans expelled their
Etruscan princes, and replaced royalty by a pair of equal colleagues
sharing most of the royal power and regal emblems except crown and
sceptre. So we get to the Rome of the earliest credible tradition&mdash;a
Rome governed by two consuls and a senate of nobles. It is a city
composed of farm-houses and in each house the head of the family rules
in patriarchal majesty.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_24" id="page_24">{24}</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Growing Republic</span></h3>

<p>Thus it is necessary to throw overboard a great mass of edifying and
famous history in the interest of youth. There were no contemporary
records, the annals and <i>fasti</i> upon which Livy’s immediate predecessors
relied in the first century <small>B.C.</small> are demonstrably of late concoction.
Everywhere we can see the influence of Greek artists importing fragments
of Greek history, rationalising names and customs, antedating and
reduplicating later constitutional struggles, writing appropriate
speeches for early parliamentarians who never existed, and generally
demonstrating the power of Greek invention to flatter Roman credulity.
The great families of 200 <small>B.C.</small> and onwards found themselves as rich and
powerful as nabobs; they had great historic names, and when there was a
funeral in the family they sent out a long procession of waxen images to
represent the noble ancestors of the deceased. At such times there would
be funeral orations recounting the deeds of those heroic ancestors.
Every family had its traditions, as glorious and as authentic as those
of the descendants of Brian Boru. When literature came into fashion and
needy Greek scribes offered a plausible <i>stilus</i> to any rich patron,
Roman history began to exist, sometimes bearing respectable Roman names
but always written in Greek. It is thus that we get the series of heroic
actions attributed to Fabii and Horatii and deeds of wicked pride
ascribed to ancestral Claudii. Whatever it may cost us in pangs for the
fate of pretty tales I fear we must not scruple to use the knife freely
in this region of literary history. A glance at the following
coincidences will help to allay our scruples: Tarquin the Roman tyrant
was driven out in the same year as Hippias the Athenian tyrant (510
<small>B.C.</small>); the Twelve Tables at Rome were drawn up in the same year as the
code of Protagoras at Thurii (451 <small>B.C.</small>); 300 Fabii died to a man in the
battle of Cremera just about the same time as 300 Spartans died to a man
with Leonidas at<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_25" id="page_25">{25}</a></span> Thermopylæ in 480 <small>B.C.</small> To put it briefly: Nothing
anterior to the Gallic invasion of 390 <small>B.C.</small> and very little for nearly
another century can be accepted on literary evidence alone.</p>

<p>So far as we can read the stones, the earliest Rome consisted of a
settlement on the Palatine Hill, with a citadel and a temple on the
Capitol, and with a forum or market on the low ground between them. On
the Esquiline Hill was a plebeian settlement. It was a pastoral and
agricultural community, expressing wealth in terms of cattle, ploughing
and reaping so much of the Campagna as their farmers could reach in a
day or their armies protect. From the very earliest times the community
consisted of a few great houses of patrician blood with numerous clients
and slaves. In every house the father was king absolute, with power of
life and death over his sons, daughters, and slaves. Daughters passed
from the hand of the father to the hand of the husband, like any other
property, by a form of sale. Out of remote antiquity comes a piece of
genuine Latin:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">SI PARENTEM PVER VERBERIT AST OLE PLORASIT PVER<br /></span>
<span class="i7">DIVIS PARENTVM SACER ESTO<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">&mdash;“If a boy beats his father and the father complains let the boy be
devoted to the gods of parents,” <i>i.e.</i> slain as a sacrifice. It was a
commonwealth of such parents&mdash;no republican lovers of liberty, be
sure&mdash;whose chiefs met to discuss policy in the temple, as the Senate,
and who themselves assembled in a body, fully armed, as the <i>comitium</i>,
to vote upon the Senate’s decrees conveyed by the consuls.</p>

<p>Grim and despotic in peace these Roman aristocrats were fierce and
tenacious in war. As soon as she was free, if not earlier, Rome appeared
as a member of the Latin League which ruled over the Plain of Latium
under the presidency of Alba Longa. This piece of tradition is attested
by many survivals in ritual. Her earliest wars were against neighbours
like Gabii, whose very name made the later Romans smile, so
insignificant a village it was. It was in these little contests<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_26" id="page_26">{26}</a></span> that
the early Romans learnt their trade as warriors, and if any one seeks to
know the causes of Rome’s victorious career the answer is, I suppose,
that she fought very bravely and obeyed her generals better than her
enemies obeyed theirs. Discipline was her secret, and discipline came,
no doubt, from the strict patriarchal system in her homes, a system
assuredly not of Mediterranean birth.</p>

<p>Whether the geese who cackled were authentic or merely ætiological fowls
I know not, but it is certain that Rome did not suffer so severely from
the Gallic invasion as did her neighbours across the Tiber. Probably it
was only the last wave of a great invasion which reached as far as Rome,
burnt the Palatine settlement and the humble wattled dwellings of the
poor on the Esquiline, and failed to storm the Capitol. At any rate the
Gallic invasion of 390 <small>B.C.</small> seems to have started the Romans on their
career of conquest, mainly at the expense of the Etruscans. But there
were incessant wars with all her neighbours; every summer the army
marched out as a matter of course. If it was not a decaying Etruscan
town to be taken by siege it was a Latin neighbour, or failing them a
Volscian or Sabine community from the hills. Summer, while the corn
could be left to do its own growing, was the time for battle. To have
been at peace in summer would have been slackness, to wage war in winter
a grave solecism. So in short space Rome became an important little
town, head of the Latin League and probably the strongest unit in
Central Italy. It appears that she began about now to emerge into
international notice by the great powers, for we have a treaty of 348
<small>B.C.</small>, which may probably be accepted as genuine though the actual date
is not so certain, between Rome and Carthage, wherein the Romans, in
consideration of promising not to trade in Carthaginian waters, are
permitted to do business with the Carthaginian ports in Sicily and
acknowledged as suzerains of the Latin League. Thus Rome has apparently
by this time some overseas traffic.</p>

<p>If no other art, diplomacy seems always to have been at<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_27" id="page_27">{27}</a></span> home on Roman
soil, and in all her works Rome shows a genius for statecraft. It must
have been at some very early date that she discovered her great secret
of <i>divide et impera</i>. She had already become so far the greatest power
in the Latin League, that she had equal rights with all the others
combined. The allies, it seems, claimed to supply the general of the
allied army on alternate days and to have a half-share of the plunder.
Against these very modest demands Rome was firm. She fought the League
and beat it in 338; then she divided and ruled the cities. With each she
made a separate treaty, granting to each two of the rights of
citizenship&mdash;the right to trade and the right to marry with her
citizens. But she allowed no such rights between the other members of
the League, however close neighbours they might be. In this way Rome
became the staple market of all Latium; all traffic passed through her
hands and her wealth and population increased.</p>

<p>These city-states had no means of ruling otherwise than tyrannically.
Their whole constitution forbade it. We have seen elsewhere<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> that
citizenship in a city-state implied membership of a corporate body, a
close partnership in a company of unlimited liability with very definite
privileges and responsibilities. Full citizenship at Rome meant a vote
in electing the city magistrates and a vote in the <i>comitium</i>, which
decided matters like peace and war. It was obvious that you had to be
very jealous about extending these rights to outsiders. But Rome went
part of the way, granted parts of the citizen rights, and thereby showed
finer imperial statecraft than any Greek state had yet discovered. Her
first offshoot was Ostia, the town she planted at the mouth of her river
only fifteen miles off, her first <i>Colonia</i>. The men of Ostia remained
citizens of Rome, and might vote in the elections if they thought it
worth while, but were exempt from the duty of serving in the army
because their own town formed a standing garrison in the Roman service.
Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_28" id="page_28">{28}</a></span> when the Romans made conquests in Etruria or Campania or any
region where the natives spoke a foreign language and therefore could
not fight in the legions under Roman officers, they would receive the
“citizenship without vote,” which enabled them simply to trade and marry
like Romans. Thirdly, some of the Latin towns became merely <i>municipia</i>,
that is, country towns enjoying full Roman citizenship if they came to
the city, but at home a local constitution with considerable powers of
self-government and a magistracy modelled on that of Rome, namely,
senators and consuls under other names. All this granting of
rights&mdash;without any tribute&mdash;was, according to the ways of ancient
city-states, surprising generosity or the deepest statesmanship. Already
Rome begins to show the genius of empire-building: she was relentless
and unscrupulous in conquering, but generous and broad-minded in
governing. Such was the wisdom of her council of despots&mdash;the Senate.</p>

<p>Nevertheless these “allies” were more sensible of the liberties they had
lost than of the rights they had gained by coming under the expanding
wing of Rome. The latter part of the fourth century shows the growing
state embarked upon a terrific struggle which lasted on and off from
summer to summer for nearly fifty years. Her principal foes were the
warlike Samnites of the Southern Apennines, closely akin, it seems, to
the dominant race at Rome. This tremendous conflict is clearly the
turning-point of Roman history. At various stages nearly all the peoples
of Italy rose and enrolled themselves among the enemy, the Latins, the
Etruscans, the Umbrians, the Marsi, the Gauls (for they too were brought
in again by the Etruscans in their last efforts for freedom) and the
Samnites themselves, a race of born fighters under competent generals.
Once, in 321 <small>B.C.</small>, both consuls and the entire army of Rome were
entrapped at the Caudine Pass, but Rome never thought of surrender.
Doggedly her Senate refused to know when it was beaten and continued the
struggle. Fortunately it was one purpose<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_29" id="page_29">{29}</a></span> against many, and Rome beat
her enemies in detail until she was able to emerge victorious.</p>

<p>The history of that great conflict has come down to us in an incomplete
state full of fairy-tales and omissions, but it is clear that the Roman
Senate showed extraordinary resolution and tenacity, as it did in the
next century against foreign enemies. Beaten to its knees again and
again it refused any terms of peace short of victory. That is a
marvellous thing, if Rome was really one among many towns of Latium. It
is to be noted that this was the war in which she learnt the new system
of fighting whereby she was fated to conquer the world. Hitherto in
ancient warfare a battle array had meant a solid line in which the men
stood shoulder to shoulder in several ranks, pressing on with spear and
shield against a similar line of the enemy. It was largely a question of
weight in the impact. You tried to make your line deep enough to prevent
yielding and long enough to envelop the enemy’s flank: once you could
turn or break the enemy’s line victory was yours. But the Romans, either
because they were often outnumbered on the field of battle, or, as some
say, in fighting the Gallic warriors with their long swords, found it
necessary to fight not shoulder to shoulder but in open order&mdash;not in a
solid phalanx but in open companies or “maniples.” This had a
far-reaching effect: it made every Roman soldier a self-reliant unit,
who could fence skilfully with his favourite weapon, the sword, instead
of merely pushing a long pike as his neighbours did. It is clear that
only an army of natural soldiers could have adopted such an innovation
successfully. Once established, it made the Roman soldier invincible.
The maniple of 200 men was not only far more mobile than a solid
phalanx, but it covered a length of ground equal to that of three times
its own numbers. Formerly only the front rank&mdash;the <i>principes</i>&mdash;had
required a full suit of armour and it was only the richest who could
afford it. Now the whole army had to be properly equipped, and this
reacted upon the social and political system of the city.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_30" id="page_30">{30}</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Constitution</span></h3>

<p>In ancient times a man’s rights as citizen depended entirely upon his
duties as a soldier. The <i>comitium</i> was the army, and the preponderance
of voting power went to the rich who could afford a panoply. Now the
soldiers were equalised and therefore the citizens claimed equality. We
cannot put much faith in Livy’s story of the struggle between the two
orders for political equality; the details, which include elaborate
reports of the speeches delivered, are clearly free compositions based
upon much later controversies between the republicans and democrats of
Livy’s own earlier days. There is a great deal of confusion and
contradiction in the accounts of the various legislative measures by
which the plebeians were gradually admitted to equality with the
patricians. But the story of the Secession of the Plebs&mdash;there are two
such stories, but probably that is the result of duplication&mdash;is so
distinctive and peculiarly Roman that it scarcely seems like an
invention. To put it shortly, the plebeians won their rights by means of
that very modern weapon&mdash;a strike. Being refused the rights for which
they were agitating, they refused to join the citizen levy, but marched
out under arms to the neighbouring Sacred Mount, and threatened to set
up a new Rome of their own there. The political instinct was healthy and
strong among them: the plebeians formed themselves into a second
corporation organised like the patricians. Where the patricians had
their two consuls with two prætors under them, the plebeians had their
two tribunes and two ædiles. Where the patrician army had its <i>comitium</i>
meeting in groups called “curies,” the plebeians had their assembly
meeting in tribes. So the new magistracies and the new meetings became
part and parcel of the Roman republic. The tribunes were protected not
so much by laws as by an oath: their persons were declared sacred, and
they had the right to thrust their sacred persons between the plebeian
offender and the consul’s lictor who came to arrest him, thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_31" id="page_31">{31}</a></span>
expressing the ultimate sovereignty of the army of Roman citizens. That
is, in broad outline, how the story of political equality at Rome has
come down to us. But it must not be supposed that even now the Roman
republic was in anything but externals like the Greek democracy. The
Roman <i>comitia</i> never debated like the Athenian <i>ecclesia</i>. They
assembled to listen to such speeches as the magistrates or their invited
friends might choose to make upon topics which had previously been
selected, discussed and decreed by the senate; they were there to ratify
the senate’s decisions with “Yes” or “No.” Even then they did not vote
as individuals; each “century,” each “cury,” or each “tribe,” according
to the form of meeting summoned, was a single voting unit. Everything in
the system tended to put real power into the hands of the executive.
When you get the executive able to control policy you get efficiency,
but if you want liberty you must adopt other means. The senate at Rome
gradually came to consist entirely of retired magistrates, and so to
exhibit all the knowledge, competence, experience, and bigoted
self-confidence which we expect from retired functionaries.</p>

<p>The republican constitution had invented two devices to save itself from
tyranny, and, according to tradition, had invented them at the very
beginning of republicanism. One was the collegial system by which every
magistracy was held in commission by two or more colleagues. There were
two consuls from the first, sharing between them most of the royal
prerogatives, heads of the executive in peace and supreme generals in
war, with power of life and death, or full <i>imperium</i>, at any rate on
the field of battle. There was at first only one prætor, for he was then
merely the consuls’ lieutenant in time of war; but when, as soon
happened, the prætor became a judge in time of peace, that office, too,
was given to a pair of colleagues. There were, it is said, at first two
tribunes of the plebs, principally charged with the protection and
leadership of their own order; but as the city grew their numbers were
increased to ten. So there were<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_32" id="page_32">{32}</a></span> two ædiles, who principally looked
after affairs of police in the city. There were two censors, ranking
highest of all in the hierarchy of office because their sphere was so
largely connected with religion. Their duty was to number the people and
to expiate that insult to heaven with a solemn rite of purification. In
numbering they also had to assess every man’s property for the purpose
of fixing his rank in the army and in the state. All these magistrates
had powers of jurisdiction in various spheres. All the priests and
prophets, too, of whom there were many varieties, were formed into
colleges. Only the <i>pontifex maximus</i> stood alone without a
colleague&mdash;and he had an official wife. We are too familiar with the
working of “boards” and “commissions” to misunderstand the purpose of
this system. Theory required unanimity in each board, each member of it
had power to stop action by the others, one powerful weapon to that end
being the religious system whereby nothing could be attempted without
favourable omens. You had only to announce unpropitious auspices to stop
any action whatever.</p>

<p>The other great check against official tyranny was the system of annual
tenure. All magistrates, except the censors, who had a lengthy task
before them and therefore held office for five years, were annual. While
this was some safeguard for liberty, it told heavily against efficiency,
especially in the case of military leadership by the consuls. It also
meant the gradual creation of a great number of office-holders, past and
present. It was not quite so effective as the corresponding Athenian
system of balloting for office in checking personal eminence, but it
certainly succeeded in putting a great number of nonentities and
failures into high office&mdash;even the supreme command of the legions.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Early Roman</span></h3>

<p>It is only very dimly that we can trace the outlines of public history
as Rome grew to be a power in Italy. We can scarcely hope to trace the
lineaments of the individual<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_33" id="page_33">{33}</a></span> Roman even in outline. It is sometimes
said that even if the earliest history of the city is admitted to be
apocryphal, we can draw valuable deductions as to the Roman character
from the sort of actions which were regarded as praiseworthy in the
earliest times. There is some truth in that view, though it might be
objected that most of these stories took literary shape only in the
second and first centuries <small>B.C.</small> It might be added that men often admire
qualities just because they feel that they themselves cannot claim them.
But, on the whole, I think we can get from this period of legendary
history some insight into Roman character. There is a remarkable
difference between the Roman hero and the Greek. Greek mythology busies
itself very largely with stories of cleverness&mdash;how Heracles outwitted
his foes, smart <i>équivoques</i> by the oracles, ingenious devices of
Themistocles, wise sayings of Thales and Solon. It is mainly the
intellectual virtues that Greek history of the borderland admires. But
the Roman of the same historical area is not clever. Most of the old
Roman stories are in praise of courage&mdash;for example, the contempt of
pain shown by Scævola, who held his right hand in the flames to
demonstrate Roman fortitude; the courage of the maiden Clœlia, who swam
the river, or of Horatius, who held the bridge against an army; the
devotion to his country of Quintus Curtius, who leapt in full armour
into the chasm which had opened in the Forum. Many of them celebrate the
true Roman virtue of sternness and austere devotion to law, as when the
Roman fathers condemned their sons to death for breaking the law under
most excusable circumstances. The love of liberty is extolled in Brutus,
the love of equality in Valerius and Cincinnatus, called from the
plough-tail to supreme command. Austere chastity in females and the
strict demand for it in their proprietors is praised in the stories of
Lucretia and Virginia. All these we may well set down as the virtues
admired and, we hope, practised in early Rome; they form a consistent
and quite distinctive picture.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_34" id="page_34">{34}</a></span></p>

<p>But the early Roman had few accomplishments to embellish his virtues.
Art and civilisation either did not exist or have perished without
leaving any traces. It is likely enough that all the city’s energies
were occupied with the one business of fighting. Some hints of
civilising reform hang about the name of Appius Claudius, who was censor
about 318-312 <small>B.C.</small> In his time we date some of the military changes
mentioned above, and they seem to have accompanied economic changes
which point to growing wealth at Rome. Copper gave place to silver as
the standard of exchange, and therewith the copper <i>as</i> depreciated in
value, so that the Roman unit of historical times, the sestertius of 2½
<i>as</i> value, was a coin worth about <i>2d.</i> Land was no longer the sole
basis of property; it became possible for a man to become rich by trade,
and accordingly landless citizens were now drafted into the ancient
tribes for the first time. To this great censor also belongs the first
of the famous Roman military roads, the Appian Way, which led southwards
to the Greek cities of Campania. Even to-day the Via Appia, flanked with
its ruined tombs&mdash;for the Romans often buried their dead along the
highways&mdash;running like a dart across the barren Campagna, is one of the
most striking spectacles which modern Rome has to offer.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Of anything which can be dignified with the name of literature we have
scarcely a relic. What there is seems ludicrously rustic and uncouth.
Consider, for an example, the ancient hymn of the Salii, the jumping
priests of Mars. There were twelve of them, all men of patrician family;
they dressed in embroidered tunics, with the striped toga, a breastplate
of bronze, a conical cap with a spike; they carried each a sacred
shield, and as they made their annual processions through the city at
the beginning of each campaigning year, they leaped into the air and
thumped their shields with sticks; trumpeters preceded them, and they
sang this ghostly chant:<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_35" id="page_35">{35}</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Early Religion</span></h3>

<p>In our quest for the essential Roman we shall find nothing more
illuminating than religion. With some people culture takes the place of
religion, but it is far commoner to find religion taking the place of
culture: it did so with the Hebrews, and it does so to a great extent
among the English. The Romans were never a really religious people.
Probably they lacked the imagination to be really devout. They had
scarcely any native mythology. But they were ritualists and formalists
to the heart’s core. If those Salii had jumped only four times at the
word “Triumpe,” the whole value of the rite would have been lost: if no
worse thing befell them they would have had to begin again from the
beginning. Thus religion, always conservative, and generally the richest
hunting-ground for the antiquarian in search of prehistoric history, is
almost our only source of information as to the mind of the early Roman.
Of course, Roman religion is so deeply overlaid with Greek mythology
that it takes some digging to discover the real gods of old Rome. But
that is being done by the patience and insight of such scholars as Mr.
Warde Fowler and Dr. J. G. Frazer, so that<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_36" id="page_36">{36}</a></span> we now have a good deal of
information about the original Roman religion.</p>

<p>Mr. Warde Fowler makes two important conclusions about the early Romans
from his study of the twofold character of Mars, who, in spite of the
later primacy of Jupiter, is undoubtedly the true Roman male god: “(1)
that their life and habits of thought were those of an agricultural
race, and (2) that they continually increased their cultivable land by
taking forcible possession in war of that of their neighbours.” This was
the Roman method of making agriculture pay. The spring of the year and
the month which still bears the name of Mars was not only the season of
returning life to nature, but it was also the time when the god and his
worshippers buckled on their armour to seek fresh ploughlands, just as
did the primitive Germans. It was Europe’s first method of extensive
farming, and the habit clung to the Romans long after they had ceased to
be farmers. In the spring it was time to look about you and consider
where and with whom you should begin to fight this year.</p>

<p>Some of these old Roman festivals are worth a brief description, for
they and they alone are the authentic history of the early Romans. For
example, on the Ides of March the lower classes streamed out to the
Campus Martius on the banks of the river and spent the day in rustic
jollity with wine and song in honour of Anna Perenna&mdash;the recurring
year. On another day there was a ceremony like that of the Hebrew
scapegoat. Two dates in the calendar are marked for the king to dissolve
the <i>comitia</i>. The assembly had to be summoned by the blast of special
trumpets of peculiar un-Italian shape (some say Etruscan), and the
trumpets had to be purified by a special service on the previous day.
Although the Romans abolished their political kingship, religion
required the retention of the title for numerous ceremonial purposes.
Then there were the Parilia in honour of the old shepherd god Pales,
when sheepfolds were garlanded with green, the sheep were purified at
the dawn, and rustic sacrifices were<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_37" id="page_37">{37}</a></span> paid to avert the wrath of the
deity in case you had unwittingly disturbed one of the mysterious powers
who dwell in the country&mdash;the nymphs and fauns of pool and spring and
tree. There was a prayer to this effect of which Ovid has given us the
substance, and “this prayer,” adds Mr. Warde Fowler, “must be said four
times over, the shepherd looking to the east, and wetting his hands with
the morning dew. The position, the holy water, and the prayer in its
substance, though now addressed to the Virgin, have all descended to the
Catholic shepherds of the Campagna.” There were other primitive
agricultural deities, such as Robigus (the red rust on the corn), on
whose festival you sacrificed red puppies; Terminus (the boundary god),
to whom you slaughtered a sucking-pig on the boundary stone; or Ops
Consiva, the deity who protected your buried store of corn. Such names
and their attributes indicate a certain poverty of religious
imagination. There were more abstract, or, rather, less tangible powers,
such as Lares, the spirits of the dead ancestors who figured as guardian
angels of the home; the Penates, the spirits who watched over the
store-cupboard; the Genius, a man’s luck; the Manes, the kindly dead; or
the Lemures, dangerous ghosts of the unburied. The house, like the
fields, was full of unseen presences to be appeased with appropriate
ritual, which had to be most punctiliously performed. Every year at the
Lemuria the master of the house would rise at midnight and, with clean
hands and bare feet, walk through the house, making a special sign with
his fingers and thumbs to keep off the ghosts. He fills his mouth with
black beans and spits them out as he goes, carefully keeping his eyes
averted, and saying, “With these I redeem me and mine.” Nine times he
speaks these words without looking round, and the ghosts come behind him
unseen to gather up the beans. Then the father washes himself again, and
clashes the pots together to frighten the spirits away. When he has
repeated the words “Depart, ye kindly spirits of our ancestors” nine
times, he looks round at last and the ceremony is complete.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_38" id="page_38">{38}</a></span></p>

<p>The history of Rome, as Mr. Warde Fowler discerns it in religion, begins
with an extremely simple rustic worship of natural forms, meteoric
stones, sacred trees and animals such as the Mother Wolf or Mars’
woodpeckers; to this stage belong many of the curious spells and charms
against ghosts. This sort of worship is not distinctively Roman, but
common to the greater part of Central Europe. From these savage local
cults we pass to the more centralised worship which belongs to the
household, and that household an agricultural one. The father is the
priest, and his principal deity is Janus, the god of the doorway; his
sons are the subordinate <i>flamines</i>; and his daughters have special
charge of Vesta, who presides over the family hearth-fire. Their
agricultural activities are reflected in the more orderly rural
ceremonies in honour of Saturn, Ops, and Vesta. Thirdly, we have a
series of cults which indicate the beginnings of a community with the
king for chief priest, supported by State Vestals and <i>flamines</i>. The
Latin Festival marks the participation of Rome in the Latin League,
whose presiding deity was Jupiter. In these three stages it is mainly an
affair of formless powers or “numina,” deities very scantily realised,
with little or no personality, scarcely to be termed anthropomorphic at
all. Instead of temples there was nothing but altars, chapels, groves.</p>

<p>If we view these changes in the light of ethnology we shall probably
agree that the first of them is the common ground of prehistoric
Mediterranean worship. It is what we find in Crete at the earliest
period. But we have come to regard the strict monogamous patriarchal
family as especially the contribution of the north to the civilisation
of Europe. Unfortunately those deities who are most certainly plebeian,
such as Ceres, Flora, and Diana, do not seem to belong to the earlier
strata of religion.</p>

<p>However that may be, it seems that we can trace in the next succeeding
stage a period of public worship connected with clearly anthropomorphic
deities who have temples,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_39" id="page_39">{39}</a></span> priests, and probably images of their own.
Towards the end of the monarchic period we find those distinctly
Etruscan characteristics of which I have already spoken. Jupiter, Juno,
and Minerva are an Etruscan trinity. Now begins the pre-eminence of
greater gods more or less personified and closely resembling those of
the Greeks&mdash;such as Mercury, Ceres, and Diana. It is now that the
important priestly colleges, pontifices, and augurs are founded, largely
replacing, as being more important politically, the old agricultural
brotherhood of the Fratres Arvales and the martial fraternity of the
Salii.</p>

<p>Thus in religion as in art the Romans were prepared by their Etruscan
connections for their subsequent capture by Greek civilisation. It was
inevitable that a Greek should recognise Diana as Artemis, Minerva as
Pallas, Mercury as Hermes, and Juno as Hera. It was equally inevitable
that the Romans should be willing to clothe these bare and chilly
abstractions with the charming fabric of Greek mythology. That process,
and the simultaneous reception at Rome of Oriental cults, form still
later stages in the progress of that strange medley which passed in the
Rome of literature for religion.</p>

<p>There is little to elevate or inspire in Roman religion. The only virtue
belonging to it was reverence and the strict sense of duty which a Roman
called <i>pietas</i>, explaining it as “justice towards the gods.” “Religion”
meant “binding obligation” to the Romans; its source was fear of the
unseen, its issue was mainly punctilious formalism. No doubt the gods
would punish disrespect to a parent or rebellion against the state, no
doubt a fugitive or a slave had altars and sanctuaries where he might
claim mercy; but there is little more than that to connect virtue with
religion at Rome. On the other hand, we are not to suppose that when the
lascivious rites of Isis and Ashtaroth or the Paphian Venus came to Rome
in later days they came to corrupt a race of pious puritans. True Roman
deities like Flora, Fortuna Virilis, and Anna Perenna had a native
bestiality of their own. The simple<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_40" id="page_40">{40}</a></span> rustic is seldom a natural puritan,
and we must beware of idealising our Early Roman as a Scottish
Covenanter. There was savage cruelty in many of the early rites, such as
the Ver Sacrum when all the offspring of men and cattle within a
specified period was devoted to the gods, or the Fordicidia when unborn
calves were burnt. Human sacrifice looms large in the early religion,
and it was probably only a later refinement which limited it to
criminals or volunteers.</p>

<p>Mommsen has drawn our attention to the business-like relation between
worshipper and god, for that is also typical of the old Roman character.
“The gods,” he says, “confronted man just as a creditor confronted a
debtor.... Man even dealt in speculation with his god: a vow was in
reality as in name a formal contract between the god and the man by
which the latter promised to the former for a certain service to be
rendered a certain equivalent return.” Nay, he might venture to defraud
his god. “They presented to the lord of the sky heads of onions or
poppies, that he might launch his lightnings at these rather than at the
heads of men. In payment of the offering annually demanded by father
Tiber, thirty puppets plaited of rushes were annually thrown into the
stream.” It may be true, as Mr. Warde Fowler argues, that the bargain
sometimes took the form of a lively sense of favours to come, but a
<i>votum</i> was essentially a business transaction.</p>

<p>The deity was very dimly visualised: the cult was everything, the god
nothing. The true Latin god does not marry or beget children&mdash;did not,
at least, till the Greek theologians came over and married them all
suitably and provided them with families. Before history began the
Romans had forgotten the little they had ever known about their most
ancient deities. The rite, perhaps the altar, was preserved, but no one
remembered the object of it. This is a typical Roman prayer as we have
it in old Cato: “This is the proper Roman way to cut down a grove.
Sacrifice with a pig for a peace-offering. This is the verbal formula:</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="plt_8" id="plt_8"></a>
<a href="images/image012_lg.jpg">
<img src="images/image012_sml.jpg" width="520" height="336" alt="[Image unavailable.]" /></a>
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Plate</span> VIII.
THE APPIAN WAY</p></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">Whether thou art a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_41" id="page_41">{41}</a></span> god or a goddess to whom that grove is sacred, may
it be justice in thine eyes to sacrifice a pig for a peace-offering in
order that the sanctity may be restrained. For this cause, whether I
perform the sacrifice or any one else at my orders, may it be rightly
done. For that cause in sacrificing this pig for a peace-offering I pray
thee honest prayers that thou mayest be kind and propitious to me and my
house and my slaves and my children. For these causes be thou blessed
with the sacrifice of this pig for a peace-offering.” To misplace a word
in this formula would have been fatal. The vagueness of the address is
typical: the wood is sacred, no doubt, to some invisible <i>numen</i>; the
woodman must guard himself against addressing the wrong power. Much of
the Roman worship is thus offered “to the Unknown God.”</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Law</span></h3>

<p>It was this quality of precision and formalism which made Rome the
lawgiver of Europe. In the battle between law and sentiment the Roman
sword has been thrown with decisive effect into the scale of law. All
Roman law was originally a series of formulæ, and like all ancient law a
part of religion. First the king and then the priests were the only
people who knew these formulæ. Thus the king was the sole judge both in
private and public right; he might summon a council of advisers or he
might delegate his powers to an inferior officer, such as the prætor or
the prefect of the city, or the trackers of murder. Both these rights,
that of choosing a consilium and of delegating authority, with, however,
a right of appeal from the lower to the higher functionary, remained
inherent in the Roman magistracy. In all cases, private or public, the
king or the magistrate who replaced him had to pronounce the <i>jus</i>
first: that is, to state the proper formula for the case in question;
then he would send the case for trial of fact, or <i>judicium</i>, before
judge or jury. The formula would run “if it appears that A. B. has been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_42" id="page_42">{42}</a></span>guilty of&mdash;&mdash; condemn him to &mdash;&mdash;; if not, acquit him.” <i>Jus</i>, human
right, was inseparably connected with <i>fas</i>, divine right: no layman
could properly interpret either. For a long time it was necessary for
one of the priests to be present in court to see that the proper
formularies of action were observed with strict verbal accuracy. This
was, of course, an enormously powerful weapon in the hands of the
patricians.</p>

<p>Then in the course of the struggle between the orders came the usual
demand for written laws. The famous story of the Decemviri and their
commission to Athens in 451 <small>B.C.</small> is unfortunately very dubious history.
It is full of romantic elements, it is part of that systematic
depreciation of the Claudii in Roman history which Mommsen has traced to
its probable source, it has elements which look as if they were borrowed
from the story of the thirty tyrants at Athens, and there is no
confirmation from the Athenian side. Professor Pais believes that the
fifth century is much too early for such a code. There are, it is true,
in the fragments of the Twelve Tables which have come down to us, some
enactments closely resembling those of the Greek codes&mdash;regulations, for
example, limiting the expense of funerals&mdash;but we find such laws in
other codes than that of Solon. One would like to have fuller details
about that later Appius Claudius, the famous censor of 312 <small>B.C.</small> It is
said that he desired to reduce the now complicated bulk of legal formulæ
to writing simply for the benefit of the priests, but that a low-born
scribe, one Flavius, whom he employed for the purpose as his clerk,
fraudulently revealed these judicial secrets to the public. The whole
tendency of the Claudian falsifications is to make out that the Claudii
were tyrannical and anti-democratic. It certainly looks as if the
dishonesty of the freedman had been put into the story for the purpose
of robbing the famous censor of his credit for helping the people to a
knowledge of law.</p>

<p>The whole fabric of Roman law was supposed to rest upon the foundation
of the Twelve Tables. Only fragments of them have come down to us. They
are undoubtedly very<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_43" id="page_43">{43}</a></span> ancient and primitive, more so, it would seem,
than the Athenian law of 451 <small>B.C.</small> Fines are to be paid in metal by
weight. A creditor has the right to carve up the body of his debtor.
Plebeian may not intermarry with patrician. But they also carried
something of a charter of liberties for the citizens in that capital
punishment could not be inflicted without right of appeal to the
assembly, and no law could be proposed against an individual. The
language of this famous code is of a rugged simplicity and directness
that is truly Roman. On the whole Roman law is merciful, considering its
strict character: though much of Roman pleading, as we have it in the
mouth of Cicero, is full of appeals to sentiment, Roman law itself
allows no appeal to anything so vague as abstract justice. The written
letter stands, and there can be no pleading without a legal formula.</p>

<p>The character of the ancient Roman is best described by his favourite
virtue of <i>gravitas</i>. In that word is implied serious purpose, dignified
reserve, fidelity to one’s promise, and a sense of duty. Levity is its
opposite, and among the things repugnant to true Roman gravity were art,
music, and literature. It is on the battlefield, in the senate-house,
and the law-courts that the old Roman is most truly at home.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_44" id="page_44">{44}</a></span></p>

/></span>HE great Samnite wars, which had lasted on and off from 343 to 290
<small>B.C.</small>, had been the school of Roman valour. In her citizen legions Rome
had evolved a fighting machine unequalled, probably, until the
Musketeers of Louis XIV. and Marlborough. Also she was learning politics
and the art of government. She was now mistress over the greater part of
Italy; all, in fact, except the Gallic plain in the north and the Greek
cities of the south. The Pyrrhic war which followed after a short
breathing-space forms the transition between domestic expansion and
foreign conquest. Our business here is not with wars and battles for
their own sake, but it will be important to observe in what manner Rome
was launched on her career of empire-making. Seeley has shown how the
British Empire grew up in a haphazard manner, without any wise policy to
direct its growth, with continual neglect of opportunities, and often in
contemptuous ignorance of the work that private citizens were
undertaking for its honour and advancement. We shall see that it was
very much the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_45" id="page_45">{45}</a></span> same with the Roman Empire. One responsibility leads to
another, one conquest leads to many entanglements: if the coast is to be
held the hinterland must be conquered. Thus power follows capacity, and
the doctrine which seems so unjust, “To him that hath shall be given,
from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he seemeth to
have,” is fulfilled in all the dealings between Providence and imperial
peoples. By coming into contact with the Greeks of the south Rome was
brought definitely to deal with a superior but declining civilisation.
The career of Agathocles, the brigand tyrant of Sicily, had lately shown
how easy a thing it was to make empires among the opulent and luxurious
cities of the Calabrian and Bruttian shores.</p>

<p>One summer’s day in 282 <small>B.C.</small> the people of Tarentum were seated in their
open-air theatre, watching the performance of a tragedy. They looked out
above the stage over the blue waters of the Gulf of Calabria, and there
they saw a small detachment of the Roman fleet sailing into their
harbour. The ships were on a voyage entirely peaceful, but there was an
old treaty forbidding the Romans to pass the Lacinian Promontory, and
these barbarians had lately been interfering in the affairs of their
Greek neighbours, always in favour of oligarchy against democracy. The
mob was seized with a sudden access of fury; they rushed down to the
harbour, butchered or enslaved the sailors, and put the admiral to
death. The Roman Senate met this atrocious insult with calm, even with
generosity. But the Tarentine mob would have no peace. Looking abroad
for a champion they invited the Prince of Epirus to their aid. Pyrrhus
was a young man of charm, ability, and ambition almost equal to that of
Alexander the Great, whose career he longed to emulate in the West. He
was called the first general of his day, and he brought with him 20,000
infantrymen of the phalanx, 2000 archers, 500 slingers, and 3000
cavalry. Moreover he had twenty Indian war elephants. The boastful
Greeks had offered to provide 350,000 infantry, but when it<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_46" id="page_46">{46}</a></span> came to the
point they would do nothing but hire a few mercenaries. However, Pyrrhus
was victorious in the first battle near Heraclea. The victory was won,
it is said, by the final charge of the elephants. The simple Romans had
never seen an elephant before; they called them “snake-hands” and
“Lucanian cows,” and their horses were even more alarmed than they. But
the next time the Romans had to meet elephants they provided themselves
first with wonderful machines, in which chariots were mysteriously
blended with chafing-dishes, and then when these failed, with fiery
darts, which converted this heavy cavalry into engines of destruction
for their owners. That is rather typical of the simple Roman and his way
of encountering monsters.</p>

<p>After the victory of Heraclea, Pyrrhus sent to Rome with overtures of
peace a smooth-tongued courtier named Cineas, who was much impressed
with the incorruptibility of the political chiefs and their wives. It
was he who described the Senate as a “council of kings,” so grave and
majestic was their bearing and discourse. Nevertheless the Roman Senate
would have made terms if it had not been for the great Censor Appius
Claudius, now blind and infirm, who laid down for the first time the
celebrated doctrine that Rome never listened to terms while there were
foreign troops on Italian soil. Therefore, although the Romans had lost
15,000 men, fresh conscripts eagerly enrolled themselves to make a new
army.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Pyrrhus, after another incomplete “Pyrrhic” victory, was
proceeding unchecked over the island of Sicily. There he drove the
Carthaginians from point to point until they concentrated in their great
stronghold of Lilybæum in the west. But all the time his position was
desperate. The coalition on which he depended was composed of faithless
and useless allies. While his stiff Epirot phalanx was depleted at every
victory, fresh levies of Roman citizens seemed to spring from the soil
to replace the losses of every defeat. So at length it came to the
battle of the Arusine Plain, near Beneventum, in which the Romans were
completely victorious.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_47" id="page_47">{47}</a></span> Thus Pyrrhus leaves to history the reputation
not of a conqueror but of an adventurer. The Romans had thus faced and
overthrown the Greek phalanx at its best, and were now masters of Italy
from Genoa to Reggio, with Sicily obviously inviting their next advance.
That Rome was now formally accepted among the great powers of the
Mediterranean world is shown by an embassy offering alliance with
Ptolemy of Egypt.</p>

<p>She had a breathing-space of eleven years before the first of her two
great conflicts with the Carthaginians. Carthage, a colony of the
Phœnicians of Tyre, had grown rich and prosperous on the fertile soil of
the modern Tunis. She was an aristocracy wholly devoted to trade, and
living uncomfortably amid a surrounding population of dangerous native
subjects. War was not her main business, but when she sought fresh
markets she was apt to fight with horrible ferocity, sacrificing her
prisoners in hundreds to hideous gods when she was victorious, and
impaling her generals when she was not. As a military power she varied
greatly: the comparatively puny Greek states of Sicily had been
maintaining a fairly equal struggle against her for centuries. But she
used the British system of sepoy troops, and thus everything depended on
the general. Had it not been for the inexperience of the Romans at sea
and the extraordinary genius of Hannibal, Carthage would never have come
as near victory as she did. We have no history of the struggle from the
Punic side, and Carthage herself must remain somewhat of a mystery even
when illuminated by the brilliant imagination of the author of
<i>Salammbô</i>.</p>

<p>In entering upon this war, which Rome did ostensibly in response to an
appeal from a parcel of ruffianly outlaws for whom she had no sympathy
whatever, we can for once discover no motive but desire of conquest.
Messina, the home of the said ruffians, was for her merely the <i>tête du
pont</i> which led from Bruttium into Sicily. The conquest of that rich
Greek island was plainly the objective, but she plunged into war<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_48" id="page_48">{48}</a></span>
without foreseeing the immensity of her undertaking. The chief interest
of the First Punic War, which lasted from 264 to 241, lies in the
creation of a Roman navy which occurred in the course of it. Although we
may agree with Mommsen that “it is only a childish view to believe that
the Romans then for the first time dipped their oars in water,” yet
tradition says that the Romans constructed a fleet in a great hurry,
taking for model a stranded Carthaginian galley. It was at any rate her
first war-fleet worth mentioning. The tradition is proved by the lack of
seamanship displayed by the Romans, for every storm cost her enormous
losses by shipwreck. The device by which she overcame the Punic ships&mdash;a
sort of grappling gangway on pulleys affixed to her masts, so that her
soldiers could fight the enemy as if on shore&mdash;was a successful but
essentially a landlubberly invention, and no doubt accounts for many of
her losses by shipwreck. Her annual consuls, transformed for the
occasion into annual admirals, had not even as much opportunity as
Colonel Blake to learn their trade. And, though Rome launched fleet
after fleet until at length she became mistress of the seas, she never
treated her navy with respect. The ships were rowed by slaves and manned
chiefly by subject allies, but the real business of fighting was done by
the 120 legionaries on each vessel, who came into action when the enemy
was grappled and the gangway fast in her deck. So the war dragged on for
nearly a generation until at length the Carthaginians made peace, and
Rome gained the coveted island. Britain is not the only empire in
history which wins victories by “muddling through.”</p>

<p>The peace was clearly nothing more than a respite: the command of the
Western Mediterranean was not yet settled. Rome spent the interval in
making fresh conquests. First she seized the opportunity, while Carthage
was involved with her native rebels, to annex the islands of Sardinia
and Corsica, alleging with more ingenuity than geographical exactitude
that these were some of the islands between Sicily<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_49" id="page_49">{49}</a></span> and Africa which
Carthage had agreed to surrender. Here we behold the simple Roman as a
diplomat. Then she was compelled to intervene in Illyria in order to
clear the Adriatic of piracy, and so acquired territory across the
water. Soon afterwards the Gauls of the northern plain began under
pressure from their kinsmen across the Alps to threaten invasion; and
Rome, after failing to gain the favour of heaven by the pious expedient
of burying a male and female Gaul alive in her Forum, marched out to
meet them, slaughtered them in thousands, and thus rounded off her
control over the peninsula. Much of this looks like conscious
empire-building.</p>

<p>In the Second Punic War, which lasted from 218 to the end of the
century, Rome was not the aggressor. At Carthage by this time the native
rebellion had been put down with a heavy hand. It seems that Carthage
had its party system, the democracy, as usual in ancient cities, being
for war, and the aristocracy of rich merchants for peace. The democracy
was led by the celebrated Barca family, who had long supplied the state
with famous generals and now occupied a position of unrivalled eminence.
Constitutionally a Carthaginian could rise no further than to be one of
the two <i>shophets</i> who corresponded to the Roman consuls, but actually
the Barcas were more like a family of dictators. From the first Hamilcar
Barca foresaw that Rome was still the enemy, and he is said to have made
his little son Hannibal swear an oath at the altar that he would
prosecute that enmity to the death. But first it was necessary to
acquire resources and an army for the purpose. This he resolved to do,
as Julius Cæsar did after him, by foreign conquest. Without orders from
home he led his army into Spain, and there began to build up a province
and a native army under his absolute control. Though Cadiz was already a
Carthaginian market and there was already a Greek colony at Saguntum,
and the ships of Tarshish were known even to King Solomon, this is the
first real appearance of Spain in history. There was<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_50" id="page_50">{50}</a></span> metal to be had
from the mines, gold, copper, and silver, and there were hardy warriors
in the hills who only needed training to become excellent soldiers. So
Carthage began to acquire a western substitute for her lost province of
Sicily. Hamilcar died; his son-in-law, Hasdrubal, was assassinated; and
then the army chose for its leader Hamilcar’s son Hannibal, then a young
man of twenty-nine.</p>

<p>This man, though his history was written exclusively by his enemies,
stands out as one of the greatest leaders in history. In strategy he was
supreme; in statesmanship he had the gift which Marlborough shared of
being able by his personal influence to hold unwilling allies together
even in adverse circumstances. He was a cultivated man who spoke and
wrote Greek and Latin. He is charged by the jealousy of the Romans with
cruelty and perfidy, but in fact history has nothing to substantiate
these charges: on the contrary his actions are often magnanimous and
honourable. His brilliance as a general largely sprang from his power of
entering into the mind of his enemy. This was the man who inherited his
father’s deep-laid plans of vengeance, and set out, his heart burning
with hatred of Rome, to fulfil them.</p>

<p>We cannot dwell upon his wonderful march over the Alps and his brilliant
series of victories on the soil of Italy. Hannibal’s whole plan of
campaign was, briefly, to invade Italy by land with a compact striking
force and raise the unwilling subjects of Rome against her, while the
main force of Carthage attacked Sicily and Italy by sea. But it
contained three serious miscalculations which brought it eventually to
ruin. First, the southern Gauls on whom Hannibal relied for his
communications and his base proved fickle and untrustworthy allies;
secondly, he found that Rome’s mild imperial system had not produced
unwilling subjects such as Carthage possessed in Africa; and thirdly, he
hoped for support from Philip of Macedon, but here he was foiled by
Roman diplomacy. Moreover, while the Romans showed a tenacity and power
of recuperation unexampled in history, Carthage her<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_51" id="page_51">{51}</a></span>self, now in the
hands of the commercial oligarchs, gave him grudging and uncertain
support. The firmness and courage of the Roman senate and people were
amazing. Beaten again and again in the field at the Ticino, the Trebia,
Lake Trasimene, and Cannæ, Rome never lost her pride. She refused offers
of help from King Hiero of Syracuse, she could find time to order the
Illyrian chiefs to pay their tribute, she actually summoned Philip of
Macedon to surrender her fugitive rebel Demetrius. She kept an army in
Spain; a fleet still cruised in Greek waters; she had an army in Sicily,
while four legions besieged Capua; she had troops in Sardinia, three
legions in North Italy, two legions as a garrison in the capital&mdash;no
fewer than 200,000 citizens under arms. When the foolish demagogue Varro
returned in defeat and disgrace from the awful disaster at Cannæ, the
senate thanked him for not having committed suicide&mdash;“for not having
despaired of the salvation of his country.”</p>

</div>

<p>No doubt Rome owed something, but not as much as her poets and orators
pretended, to the cautious tactics of Quintus Fabius. At any rate, he
gave her time to grow used to the presence of the invader and to recover
from the shock of the three disasters with which the war opened. The
Romans had never before been called upon to face a consummate
strategist. Pyrrhus had been, within the limitations of Greek warfare, a
clever tactician; he had even shown the originality to copy the Roman
manipular system in his later battles. But Hannibal was more than a
strategist; he was a psychologist who knew when the opposing general was
rash and when he was wary, who had spies everywhere and could supplement
their intelligence by disguising himself to do his own scouting.
Scouting was an art that the Romans had yet to learn by bitter
experience. At the Trasimene Lake<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> they blundered straight into the
most obvious of natural death-traps. But the Romans were always good
learners, and, as usually happens, the amateur patriot army steadily
improved during the war<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_52" id="page_52">{52}</a></span> while the hired professionals steadily
deteriorated. The actual strategy by which Hannibal won most of his
battles was simple enough. It was the policy of a long weak centre into
which the Roman legions buried themselves deep while the two strong
wings of the enemy closed round on their flanks and rear. In his
Numidian horsemen Hannibal had the finest light cavalry yet known to
European warfare.</p>

<p>For a time all went brilliantly for the invader. Italians, Greeks, and
Gauls joined his victorious standard. Rome was on the brink of despair.
The very gods began to tremble; their statues sweated blood, two-headed
lambs were born with alarming frequency, and cows in Apulia uttered
prophetic warnings with human voices; the most horrible of omens
portended destruction. But the city and the senate never lost heart and
gradually as the years passed by Hannibal began to see that his cause
was lost. The Latin allies stood firm for Rome. The Romans were able to
hold Sicily and even despatch a brilliant and lucky young general named
Scipio to reconquer Spain. Thus the longed-for reinforcements were cut
off. The stupid aristocracy of Carthage were jealous of their great
soldier, and when at last a reinforcing Punic army from Spain managed to
slip through into Italy, Nero caught it at the River Metaurus just
before the junction was effected. The first news of that battle came to
Hannibal when the Romans tossed over the rampart into his camp the
bleeding head of the defeated general, his own brother Hasdrubal. Horace
has sung of this tragic episode in his noblest manner:</p>

<p class="nind">This was in 207: in 206 Scipio won a decisive victory in Spain and in
205 made a counter-invasion upon the coast of Carthage. It was only “a
forlorn hope of volunteers and disrated companies,” but it caused the
recall of Hannibal and gained valuable African allies for Rome. The last
scene of the duel was the victory of Zama in 202 in which Scipio won his
title of Africanus and became the hero and saviour of Rome.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Carthage
ceded Spain and the Spanish islands, lost her whole war-fleet, came
under Roman suzerainty and agreed to pay an enormous indemnity. But her
end was not yet. For another fifty years she was permitted to exist on
sufferance in humiliation and agony.</p>

<p>Now, frightful as had been the losses of Rome in this seventeen-years’
conflict, and great as was her exhaustion, she proceeded in the very
year following the peace with Carthage to enter upon a fresh series of
campaigns. The Gauls of the north made a desperate revolt, sacked
Piacenza and invested Cremona, but the Romans quickly brought them to
reason. The Gauls could not, of course, receive any of the rights of
citizenship as yet, but they received back their independence, and were
left free of tribute to act as a bulwark against their northern cousins.
There was incessant fighting in Spain also. In Sardinia there were
perpetual slave-drives, until the market was glutted with slaves, and
the phrase was begotten “as cheap as a Sardinian.” How could the senate
at such<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_54" id="page_54">{54}</a></span> a moment declare a fresh war with the greatest of European
powers? Was it under pressure of that greedy commercial party at Rome of
which we are beginning to hear so much? The suggestion is absurd. There
were hard knocks and little money to be got from Macedon; and it is
difficult to conceive how any powerful commercial interests could have
arisen at Rome during the seventeen years of the Hannibalic War. If ever
there was a nation whose early history declined the economic
interpretation it was the Romans. Even when the Romans had conquered
Macedon they shut down the famous gold mines because they did not know
how to manage them! Nor, I think, was it any large-minded <i>Welt-politik</i>
which led Rome into the Second Macedonian War. Doubtless Philip and the
Greeks were dangerous and uncomfortable neighbours, and no doubt it was
true that Philip of Macedon and Antiochus of Syria had formed a compact
to divide up the realms of the boy-king of Egypt. But the war could
probably have been postponed for years by negotiation. Philip did not
want to fight Rome: he had not even ventured to intervene while she was
almost prostrate before Hannibal. The fact is that the Romans were by
habits and instinct a fighting people. From the earliest times they had
inherited the custom of an annual summer campaign. Peace did not present
itself to them, or most of their neighbours, as a desirable condition to
be preserved as long as possible. They were soldiers and nought else,
and what are soldiers for but for fighting? It is only blind optimism
which can believe that nations are even now actuated habitually in their
international relations by foresight and policy. “The plain truth is,”
said William James, “that people <i>want</i> war. They want it anyhow; for
itself, and apart from each and every possible consequence. It is the
final bouquet of life’s fireworks.” That is certainly true of the
Romans: the Roman state, as a whole, needed its customary annual
campaign. It was the business of her statesmen and diplomats to choose
the enemy and prepare a <i>casus belli</i>. To imagine the states of 200 <small>B.C.</small>
as always<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_55" id="page_55">{55}</a></span> calculating their actions solely on the basis of commercial
interest must be unhistorical.</p>

<p>In their attack on Philip the Romans were allied with the most
respectable elements in Levantine politics: Rhodes, the commercial
republic; Pergamum, the kingdom of the cultivated Attalus; Athens, the
ancient home of art and learning; Egypt, the centre of commerce and
literature. Elsewhere<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> I have described how the simple Romans
comported themselves in this land of higher civilisation. They trod
almost reverently into the circle of Greek culture; they were flattered
when the Athenians initiated them into the Eleusinian Mysteries, or when
the Achæan League permitted them to take part in the Isthmian games. And
when they had beaten Philip&mdash;not without difficulty, nor without
indispensable aid from the Ætolian cavalry&mdash;at Cynocephalæ, they made no
attempt at annexation. Leaving Philip crippled, they were content.
Flamininus, their Philhellenic general, was proud to proclaim the
liberty of Greece before he retired. He and many of his officers carried
away with them an ineffaceable impression. They were returning to
barbarism from a land rich in ancient temples of incredible splendour,
crowded with works of art. They had seen the tragedies in the theatres,
the runners in the games. They had heard the philosophers disputing in
the colonnades, the orators haranguing in the market-place. A world
glowing with life undreamt-of, where there were other things to live for
than battle, had suddenly flashed upon their eyes.</p>

<p>The next great war was against Philip’s accomplice, Antiochus of Syria.
This war was as inevitable as the last. Antiochus, puffed up with the
pretensions of an Oriental King of Kings, was eager to match his
strength against the <i>parvenus</i> Romans. Rome seemed, and perhaps was,
reluctant to undertake the apparently enormous task at this moment,
though Pergamum and Rhodes invoked her assistance. One strong cause for
war was that Antiochus had given a home to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_56" id="page_56">{56}</a></span> Hannibal, Rome’s hunted but
dreaded foe. If the Great King had but had the sense to give Hannibal
power over his great host it might yet have gone hard with the Romans.
As it was, the battle of Magnesia (190) was one of those tame victories
in which Oriental hosts are butchered by superior Western weapons and
methods of fighting. But even with the wealth of Syria spread out at her
feet, Rome annexed nothing; not out of any spirit of self-denial, for
she exacted an indemnity of almost four million sterling, but because
she was not prepared to undertake the responsibility of governing
regions so vast and so much more civilised than herself.</p>

<p>Actually, of course, the effect of these wars was to give Rome complete
command of the Mediterranean coast-lands. Though she did not annex, she
accepted suzerainty; that is, she controlled, or attempted to control,
foreign policy. Rome is the patron; Macedonia, Syria, Egypt, Pergamum,
Rhodes, Bithynia, Athens, the two leagues and all the ancient states of
Greece are her clients. The position of policeman and nurse of the Ægean
world had been thrust upon Rome because she was strong and just. Even
that was a terrific and bewildering responsibility. Every day fresh
embassies came to Rome to complain of neighbours and solicit
assistance&mdash;clever Greeks who would talk your head off with sophistries,
and rich Asiatics who would corrupt you with bribes and blandishments.
There was no one within reach who would stand up and fight squarely. In
the West there were Provinces, in the East allies; it was difficult to
know which gave most trouble.</p>

<p>So we come to the next stage, when the Romans began to annex and
subjugate. It was the only way. In Macedonia, after Philip had been
conquered and pardoned, Perseus arose and rebelled. After Perseus had
been crushed and his kingdom dismembered, a bastard pretender arose and
headed a revolt, joined by the Greeks. Obviously there was nothing for
it but to round off the business by sending a permanent army under a
permanent general to Macedonia, and to call it<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_57" id="page_57">{57}</a></span> his “province.” Not even
yet did the Romans dream of making cities like Athens her subjects.
These free cities, however, needed a sharp lesson; and Corinth, as an
almost impregnable fortress which had been a centre of Achæan mischief,
was selected for destruction and destroyed in 146 <small>B.C.</small></p>

</div>

<p>In the same year came the end of Carthage. During the last fifty years
there had been incessant trouble there. Rome had left Carthage prostrate
before her dangerous African enemies, and refused all her appeals to be
allowed to defend herself. All the time Carthage was undoubtedly
recovering financially from her defeat, in spite of her large annual
tribute. This sight moved the fears and jealousy of the Romans. It was
not sufficient to have ordered the expulsion of Hannibal. The Romans who
had grown up under the shadow of the great Punic War had sucked in hate
and fear of Carthage with their mother’s milk. Intelligent people like
Scipio, who had seen Carthage in the dust, might mock at their fears. It
was the Old Roman party, with their spokesman Cato and his stupid
parrot-cry of <i>delenda est Carthago</i>, who constantly kept their nerves
on edge, until at last in sheer panic they obeyed. The long feud between
Carthage and the Berber chief Masinissa came to a head in 154. Masinissa
appealed to Rome, and Rome ordered Carthage to dismiss her army and burn
her fleet. Carthage, now desperate, refused, went to war with Masinissa,
and was beaten. Then Rome declared war upon her&mdash;the Third Punic War.
Two consuls landed with a large army and Carthage offered submission.
The consuls demanded complete disarmament. Carthage submitted. Then the
consuls demanded that the existing city should be destroyed and the
inhabitants settled ten miles inland. That meant not only the
destruction of their homes and hearths and temples, but the end of the
commerce for which they lived. This preposterous demand shows that
Cato’s policy had triumphed. Carthage could not submit to this, and
there followed one of those frightful sieges in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_58" id="page_58">{58}</a></span> the Semitic
peoples show their amazing tenacity. Three years it lasted, by favour of
the gross incompetence of the Roman generals; until at last a Scipio
came to turn the tide once more. Carthage was destroyed utterly with
fire and sword, her very site laid bare, and the soil sown with salt, in
token that man should dwell there no more.</p>

<p>The destruction of these two cities, Corinth and Carthage, together with
other facts such as the unreasonable irritation which Rome displayed
against her Greek allies, Rhodes and Pergamum, have been taken by some
modern historians to indicate, once more, a policy of commercial
jealousy instigating the destruction of rival markets. In the one case,
however, it has been proved that Corinth was no longer a great centre of
Greek commerce when she was destroyed, and in the case of Carthage it
was the party of Cato, who was much more of a farmer than a
company-promoter, that urged destruction. A man of business might indeed
be foolish enough to want to close the principal markets which bought
and sold with him&mdash;there are such business men to-day&mdash;but he would
scarcely be so mad as to have a fine commercial centre with its docks
and quays utterly destroyed and cursed for ever. Similarly, when Macedon
was conquered her rich gold mines were shut down by order of the senate.
The truth is that Rome was tired and exhausted with her colossal wars,
irritable and nervous beyond expression with the gigantic task of
government which she had found thrust upon her. Surrounded with false
friends and secret enemies, she was losing the noble <i>sang froid</i> she
had displayed in times of real crisis. Corinth was destroyed as a
warning to the Greeks, Carthage as an expiation for the <i>lemures</i> of the
unburied Roman dead.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Provinces</span></h3>

<p>In considering the ancient, imperial, and provincial systems it is
necessary for the modern to divest himself of all the geographical
notions which spring from the study of maps.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_59" id="page_59">{59}</a></span> The ancients probably had
only the most vague notions of territory. Natural frontiers such as
mountains, rivers, and coasts were of course familiar to them, from the
strategic point of view. Within those were cities great and small, which
in the case of civilised people formed the units of life and government.
In the case of barbarians there were tribes and nations, seldom
sufficiently settled to produce any notion of geographical area. Thus
when Rome conquered Sicily she was acquiring not so much one
geographical unit, an island, as a collection of states of various types
and constitutions. Similarly in the case of Spain; she said and thought
that she acquired Spain, although the greater part of the Iberian
peninsula remained unconquered for another century and a half. To
remember the limitations of ancient geographical knowledge is essential
to the understanding of the Roman provincial system. <i>Provincia</i> means
in the first instance a sphere of official duty, a man’s <i>provincia</i>
might be the feeding of the sacred geese or it might be the control of
an army. It was not for a long time that the word came to connote a
territorial area. When it did so, the day of the city-state was at an
end.</p>

<p>The earliest Roman provinces were <i>Sicily</i>, acquired by conquest in the
First Punic War, 241 <small>B.C.</small>, then <i>Corsica</i> and <i>Sardinia</i>, annexed in the
diplomatic intrigues which followed. Spain, or rather “<i>the Spains</i>.”
Further and Hither, were the fruit of the Second Punic War (201). After
the Third Punic War (146) the territory of Carthage became a province
under the name of <i>Africa</i>. At the same time the Macedonian Wars gave
Rome the province of <i>Macedonia</i>. To complete the list so far as the
Roman Republic is concerned: Attalus III. bequeathed his kingdom to Rome
in 133, and this became the province of <i>Asia</i>. In 121 the conquest of
Southern Gaul gave Rome <i>Gallia Narbonensis</i>. In 103 the prevalence of
piracy on the southern coasts of Asia Minor compelled the Romans to make
<i>Cilicia</i> a province. In 81 a legislative act of Sulla brought the
already conquered<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_60" id="page_60">{60}</a></span> <i>Cisalpine Gaul</i> into the same category. The King of
<i>Bithynia</i> imitated Attalus in bequeathing his kingdom to Rome. <i>Cyrene</i>
also was bequeathed to Rome and united in one province with <i>Crete</i> in
63. In 64 Pompeius the Great deposed the King of <i>Syria</i> and annexed his
kingdom. About the same time, on the death of Mithradates, <i>Pontus</i> was
added to Bithynia as a united province. In 51 Julius Cæsar completed the
conquest of Gaul and added it as <i>Gallia Comata</i> to the old province of
Narbonensian Gaul. Finally in 31 Octavianus added <i>Egypt</i> to the list.</p>

<p>It was not the Roman way to think a situation out with the logic and
directness of a Greek or a Frenchman. More like the Englishman, he took
things as they came and made the best of them with as little derangement
as possible of his pre-existing system and preconceived ideas. The Roman
Empire was not governed on a system as it was not acquired by a policy.
When Sicily came into the Roman hands, it came piecemeal in the course
of the war. Various cities accepted Roman “alliance” on various terms.
Rome had never been able to grant full citizenship to Greek states,
because their inhabitants, speaking a foreign language, could not give
the equivalent in military service. If Sicily had been Italian it would
no doubt have entered the Roman alliance as a collection of municipia;
as it was, the sixty-five or so separate Sicilian states continued to
enjoy for the most part their previous constitutions under various
agreements with Rome. Some were “free,” some were “free and
confederate”; similarly of kings who yielded to Rome, some were styled
“allies,” some “allies and friends.” The cities would have their
charters and the kings would have their personal treaties with Rome
which lapsed with their death. But in a region conquered in war most of
the tribes or states were simply “stipendiary,” that is, tribute-paying.
The <i>stipendium</i> paid was originally, and in theory, an indemnity or a
contribution for the maintenance of a military force by people who were
unqualified to give personal service. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_61" id="page_61">{61}</a></span> generally settled by a
commission of ten members of the senate, who went out to organise a
newly acquired territory. Even these tributary states had their charters
from Rome. The <i>stipendium</i> was by no means extortionate. In Macedonia,
for example, the people only paid to Rome half as much as they had
previously paid to their kings. In Sicily and Sardinia the tillers of
the soil paid a tithe, generally in kind (that is, in corn), to the
Roman treasury, and the town-dwellers probably paid a poll-tax. It was
an error of the jurists, who confused this tithe with the tenth paid by
occupants of Roman public land, which afterwards led to the dangerous
legal theory that Rome had acquired the whole soil of the country
conquered by her arms and leased it back for a consideration to the
original proprietors. As a matter of fact, few of the provinces were
remunerative to the Roman state. Spain, where warfare was incessant, was
certainly a heavy loss. Macedonia was no source of profit. Sicily,
largely owing to the Roman Peace, became the granary of the capital, but
Asia alone was a source of great wealth to the treasury. There were, of
course, harbour dues for the provinces as for Italy herself.</p>

<p>On the whole, it is fair to say that local autonomy was generally
preserved. Either through policy or, more probably, because the Romans
habitually took things as they found them, the previous laws and
constitutions of conquered units, whether cities or tribes, remained in
force. In Syracuse, for example, the law of King Hiero remained, and it
was much better for the Sicilians to pay their taxes to Rome than to be
subject to the personal extortions of a monster like Agathocles. In
law-suits between citizens of one Sicilian state the trial was to be
held in that state by a native judge and according to the native
laws&mdash;possibly with a right of appeal to the Roman governor. In suits
between Romans and Sicilians the judge was to be a native of the
defendant’s state. So far the Roman sway is the mildest, the most
benevolent system of government which has ever been<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_62" id="page_62">{62}</a></span> imposed by an
empire upon conquered subjects. Athens, it will be remembered, had grown
rich and beautiful by misapplying the contributions of allies which she
had converted into the tribute of subjects. Sparta had put garrisons
into every conquered city. So had Carthage. No modern power allows as
much local autonomy to conquered territories as Rome granted to hers.</p>

<p>But in every conquered territory it was necessary to have an armed
force, large or small according to circumstances, and for the soldiers a
general. As all the Roman magistrates were military in the first
instance, but also judicial and executive&mdash;as, in fact, the nature of
Roman ideas of <i>imperium</i> implied an unlimited competence in every
department of rule, the provincial general was also, necessarily, a
provincial judge and administrator free from all control during his year
of office. No doubt the Romans, if they had possessed the wisdom and
retrospective foresight so lavishly displayed by their modern critics,
would, in sending officers to distant parts, have revised their notions
of <i>imperium</i> and defined the spheres of duty which they entrusted to
their generals. If they had studied political science they might have
learnt that it is wise to separate the legal functions from the
administrative, and both from the military. Or if they had made
historical researches, they might have discovered that the Persian
administrative system of three independent functionaries in each satrapy
was the best that had yet been discovered. But they did none of these
things: they simply blundered on in the old Roman way, <i>more maiorum</i>.
They did not foresee the demoralising effect of absolute power in an
alien and subject land. They did not foresee the necessity for central
control in a Roman Colonial Office; there was not even any Latin
equivalent for the Franco-Grecian term “bureaucracy.” Thus they were
compelled to trust to the honour and sense of justice which was, when
this colossal experiment began, still believed to exist in the heart of
a Roman officer and gentleman, unaware that corruption<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_63" id="page_63">{63}</a></span> was beginning
even then to taint the whole body of their aristocracy.</p>

<p>They might, one would think, have realised the super-human temptations
in the path of a Roman governor. He went out, with a company of his own
friends, chiefly ambitious young men, for a staff, with a senatorial
legate chosen by himself, and a juvenile quæstor as his subordinate to
keep accounts, if he could: for there was no competitive examination in
book-keeping. The governor went for a year only among a people whose
traditions, laws, and even language, were probably quite unknown to him.
He left an austere and barbarous republic to act as monarch among
flattering Greeks or cringing Asiatics. No power on earth could even
criticise him while he held the <i>imperium</i>: afterwards he might be
impeached, it is true, but before a court of his own friends. He had
just completed a civic magistracy, and these were won and held by means
of lavish bribes and public entertainments. Opportunities to recoup
himself were irresistible.</p>

<p>True to the <i>mos maiorum</i>, the Romans invented no new magistracy for the
provinces. Already as early as the Samnite Wars they had found it
necessary sometimes to break down the annual system by proroguing a
magistrate’s term of office in order that he might finish a campaign. If
he were prætor or consul, he continued for another year as proprætor or
proconsul. When Sicily was conquered the Romans added another prætor to
the two functionaries already existing, another for Sardinia, and two
more for Spain; but after that the new provinces were entrusted to
proprætors and proconsuls, or, in case of a war, to the consuls
themselves during the latter part of their year of office. The senate
decided what the magisterial provinces should be, which of them should
be consular, and then generally the qualified officers balloted for
them.</p>

<p>The same want of elasticity in the Roman system spoilt their good
intentions in the matter of finance. As we have seen, the State imposed
no crushing burdens upon its vassals.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_64" id="page_64">{64}</a></span> Had the <i>stipendium</i> been
honestly collected by official emissaries under proper control, the
provincials would have had little cause of complaint. But the Romans
here again provided no new functionaries for the new duty. In some cases
they allowed the subject communities to collect their own taxes and
forward the required aggregate to Rome, and in such cases there was a
great deal of peculation on the way. But where this was impossible the
senate farmed out the collection of taxes under contract to certain
individuals who bought them at auction. The <i>publicani</i> quickly grew
into a regular institution, grouping themselves into capitalist
syndicates which combined tax-farming with money-lending. Banks were
established in every provincial centre. This capitalist class soon
established itself as a political body at Rome, where it exerted a
powerful and sinister influence over public policy. Just below the
senatorial order were the <i>equites</i>. Of old they had been real cavalry,
for it was only the rich who could afford to maintain a horse and the
necessary equipment; now it was mainly a titular distinction, implying a
certain income. It was here that the bankers of Rome and the financial
interests were grouped in a single powerful class. For a time these
“horsemen” actually secured control of the jury courts which tried
charges of extortion. Then the lot of the provincials was wretched
indeed: to pay their greedy and extortionate tax-gatherers they had
often to borrow from the same individuals in their capacity of usurers,
and then, if they ventured to journey to Rome with a complaint, they
would meet the same evil class in the very judges who heard their
complaints. This was how “publican and sinner” came to be an appropriate
conjunction.</p>

<p>The corruption, as we shall see later, began to be serious with the
acquisition of Asia. At first the incompetence due to the inexperience
of the governors and their staffs was the chief failing of the system.
But when Asia with its stored-up capital, its possibilities of
exploitation, and its extreme help<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_65" id="page_65">{65}</a></span>lessness, fell to Rome, traders and
money-lenders swarmed down upon it, so that there were 80,000 Italians
there when Mithradates ordered his famous massacre. Thus money poured
into the capital, and there was an unseemly scramble for wealth. But for
the present we are only concerned with the system of provincial
government as it was in the beginning. I think we may conclude that it
started with the best intentions, but with two inherent defects, both
due to the conservatism of the Roman character. Their constitution was
municipal and their outlook parochial. Their empire-building was
precisely of the narrow-minded, well-intentioned character that one
would expect if the Marleybone Borough Council suddenly found itself
presented with Ireland, France, and half Spain, and asked to govern
them.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Imperial City</span></h3>

<p>A poor man cannot become a millionaire without at least altering his way
of living, and a little backward provincial town cannot find itself the
mistress of a great empire without undergoing very profound
modifications. In 208 <small>B.C.</small> Rome was struggling for her life with a
foreign enemy raging at her gates. Fifty years later she was mistress in
the Mediterranean, and owner of more land than she could conceive.</p>

<p>One of the effects of the change was a prodigious influx of wealth into
the city. In war indemnities alone six or seven millions sterling must
have flowed into the coffers of a state which had till recently
conducted its business with lumps of copper. In loot Rome was said to
have gained above two millions in the Syrian War, and about the same in
the Third Macedonian. Vast tracts of public land were gained, and there
was a steady influx of tributary corn and money: public mines, such as
those in Spain, must be added. There never had been regular direct
taxation in the city: a Roman paid his dues in the form of personal
service, and a <i>tributum</i> was the mark of defeat. But now all taxation
ceased at Rome except an indirect tariff on salt and the customs at the
ports.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_66" id="page_66">{66}</a></span> Henceforth Rome was living on her empire and growing fat upon
it. It is true that expenditure was also increasing. In the earliest
days there had been no public finance. A war was conducted by a citizen
army, who marched out for a few days’ campaigning in the neighbourhood,
wearing their own armour and carrying a commissariat provided by their
wives. The only public expense was the religious duty of providing
beasts for sacrifice, and even that was largely defrayed by fines paid
to the treasury. But now expeditions cost money, armies soldiering for
months in distant lands had to be fed and maintained, ships had to be
built, equipment and machines provided. Nevertheless, with wise
financial administration the treasury ought to have had a decent
surplus. But wisdom in finance was lacking: although we are assured that
book-keeping was one of the points in which the old Roman paterfamilias
especially took pride, yet the public treasury of Rome, which had the
temple of Saturn for its bank, was managed by the quæstors, the lowest
grade of Roman official life, consisting of young men just beginning a
public career. That fact alone will show how far more important the
Romans regarded warfare than finance, and how far wrong are those
historians who make Roman greatness dependent upon economic advantages.
The maladministration of finance was not due to dishonesty at first:
Polybius, the Greek historian, who was brought up in the heart of Greek
politics under Aratus, the cunning chief of the Achæan League, and came
to Rome in the second century as a hostage, was genuinely astonished at
Roman honesty. Their financial errors were due to sheer inexperience in
the handling of large sums of money.</p>

<p>Little of this vast influx of money was spent upon public works. To
begin with, there was not the taste for fine architecture at Rome, nor
indeed for art of any sort. The private houses were still mainly built
of unbaked bricks or tiles, often with thatched or shingled roofs: the
interiors of the bare simplicity of a country farm-house. And then<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_67" id="page_67">{67}</a></span>
Roman religion, which, as we have seen, was always somewhat cold towards
the high Olympian gods, offering its real devotion to obscurer rustic
powers, made little claim for temples and stately shrines. Temples had
been built under the Etruscan domination in the fifth century <small>B.C.</small> But
thereafter for a period of four centuries there is an almost complete
blank in the annals of Roman archæology. If anything was built between
Tarquin and Sulla it was generally of wood and brick or rubble with no
architectural pretensions. Augustus swept it all away with contempt. Of
course it was the fashion for Cato and the old Roman party to say they
preferred good old Roman temples with the painted terra-cotta ornaments
to all the new-fashioned fripperies of Greece; but that is only the
spleen of the outraged Philistine. These centuries of growth are empty
of art.</p>

<p>What the <i>nouveaux riches</i> of the second century <small>B.C.</small> found to spend
their money on it is hard to say. In 218 <small>B.C.</small> the people passed a
resolution as the Lex Claudia forbidding senators to engage in foreign
commerce. It is very unlikely that the senate would have allowed that if
they had already been deeply involved in business. But this enactment
checked the only fruitful use of wealth: it turned, and was possibly
intended to turn, the money of the great houses into land speculation.
This was followed by disastrous results. The Punic Wars had thrown
millions of acres out of cultivation. That land which had belonged to
rebels passed to the Roman state as public land and the scramble for it
was the cause of momentous political conflicts in the succeeding
generation. But rich senators acquired enormous estates without any deep
interest in their economic productiveness. Like the old English squire
the old Roman senator was not a professional nor even a very serious
landowner, and moreover he was an absentee. Thus large tracts of Central
Italy became the estates of rich men who added park to park and villa to
villa rather as a hobby than for any good reason. The common notion of
Italy before the Punic Wars as a vast<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_68" id="page_68">{68}</a></span> smiling cornfield, dotted with
little farm-houses and country cottages full of stalwart husbandmen, is
both unhistorical and ungeographical. The Italian farmer lived&mdash;like the
mediæval European farmer&mdash;mostly in townships which he called “cities,”
and it was only the plain-land in the vicinity of a town which was
regularly ploughed and sown. A glance at the map will show how little of
Central Italy is suited for cereal cultivation. But, if the records are
true, 400 Italian townships had been destroyed in the great wars and
that meant, perhaps, 400,000 acres out of cultivation. And what had
become of their inhabitants? Thousands, of course, had left their bones
on Roman battlefields, but thousands more, when their term of service
was done, went to swell the proletariat of Rome. There they herded in
ill-built, ill-drained quarters on the low ground of the city.
Physically and morally they declined. What is perhaps worse, they could
not perpetuate their breed under the new conditions. It takes
generations for the human animal to adapt itself to new conditions.
Modern Europe has seen the enormous influx into towns accompanied by a
decline in the birth-rates, and the swollen town-populations are only
maintained by constant influx from the country. It has truly been said
that the future rests with the race which can most readily adapt itself
to such new conditions. But the Romans never could. The humbler quarters
of the city, though they grew more and more populous, grew, it seems, by
immigration and not by natural increase. Thus the populace of Rome
became more and more cosmopolitan, less and less Roman. These
generalisations are apparently well founded, but it must not be
forgotten that we know scarcely anything of the free poor at Rome. A
nation of orators generally forgets to speak of the butcher, the baker,
and his colleagues. It is as impossible to believe that all trade and
industry at Rome was carried on by slaves as that the poor of a city can
live by bread alone. “Bread and the circus” is a respectable phrase, as
true as epigrams ever are, but it cannot be the whole truth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_69" id="page_69">{69}</a></span></p>

<p>As we have seen in the case of Greece, all ancient city-states undertook
duties which the modern individualistic community regards, up to the
present at least, as private and not public. The city-state regarded it
as part of its business to see that its shareholders did not starve,
therefore the supply of corn and the price of it was always a matter of
state supervision. From the earliest days of Roman history there had
been officers charged with the duty of securing<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_70" id="page_70">{70}</a></span> the city’s corn-supply
at reasonable charges. Now the corn was beginning to arrive in the form
of tribute from Sicily and Africa. Soon we shall have the agrarian laws
and all the disorder that resulted from them. But it is important to
observe that the depopulation of the Italian countryside resulted from
war and politics as well as from economic causes. Of course economic
causes kept it depopulated. Nature never intended Central Italy for a
wheat-growing land; the vine, the olive, and the fig are its best
products. Now that the seas were open for free imports it no longer paid
to plough and sow the stony upland farms.</p>

<p>So the land passed out of cultivation. As in England, grazing was found
to be cheaper, easier, and more profitable than agriculture. Oxen were
used for ploughing or reserved for sacrifice. The Italians, like the
Greeks, seldom ate meat and then little but smoked bacon, but as all
Romans wore the woollen toga sheep-farming was profitable. In summer the
sheep grazed on the Sabine hills, in winter on the Latin plain among the
stubble of the cornfields or beneath the olive-trees. Wild
slave-shepherds tended them.</p>

<p>Slavery was the canker at the root of ancient civilisation. It assumed
more awful proportions at Rome than in Greece owing to the hard
materialism of the Roman character. Of course it had existed from the
earliest times as the common lot of the prisoner of war. The sturdy
Roman farmer, so dear to Roman rhetoric, was after all little more than
a sturdy slave-driver. The actual field labour had always been in the
hands of slaves. As early as 367 <small>B.C.</small>, if we may believe the records of
that age, legislation had attempted to fix a certain proportion of free
labour on country estates. From the first, too, the slave had been the
merest chattel, a colleague of the dog, a little lower even than the
wife or daughter of the Roman house-father. It was cheaper to buy slaves
than to let them breed, cheaper to sell them for what they would fetch
when they grew old than to keep them. You could dodge the gods, who
enjoined holidays even for slaves, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_71" id="page_71">{71}</a></span> giving your slaves work indoors
on feast-days&mdash;such are some of the maxims of the venerable Cato, who is
the type of the old Roman squire, and who personally attended to the
scourging of his slaves after dinner. Now slaves were becoming more
numerous and cheaper than ever&mdash;you might have to pay as much as £1000
for a pretty boy or girl&mdash;but a wild Sardinian or Gaul or Spaniard cost
very little. Hence began the really pernicious system of specialised
slavery. A wealthy Roman moved neither hand nor foot for himself. To
have only ten slaves was contemptible poverty. Each slave was trained
simply for one special task&mdash;cook, barber, footman, bearer, lacquey, or
schoolmaster. The shepherds and gladiators might retain their manhood,
as indeed they did, and showed it in frightful revolts during this and
the succeeding generation. But the domestic slaves of the capital had no
hope but to cringe and wheedle their way into favour by flattering and
corrupting their masters. One alleviation of the slave’s lot there was:
it was easier for a slave to earn his freedom at Rome than in Greece.
But this type of person when liberated, and his children after him, made
the worst type of citizen, and tended still further to corrupt the tone
of the proletariat. Worse than domestic slavery was the plantation
system, which during all this period was growing in the country. At its
worst it meant huge slave barracks, in which the slaves lived in
dungeons underground and worked by day in gangs, chained night and day.
It was a profitable system of agriculture and it rapidly ousted free
labour. In the city too, in the merchant ships and the mines, a cruel
and vicious system of servitude was destroying free industry. Truly the
hollowest of historic frauds was the eighteenth-century view of an
idealised Roman republic of citizens, free, equal, and fraternal. It
inspired the Convention and coloured the periods of Mirabeau, but so far
as the records prove, the virtuous and liberal old Roman never existed.</p>

<p>Equality beyond the name was certainly unknown at Rome. All government
was in the hands of a close circle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_72" id="page_72">{72}</a></span> aristocrats whose stronghold was
in the senate. By virtue of the client system the great houses of the
Claudii, the Cornelii, the Fabii, the Livii, the Flaminii, the Julii,
and a dozen others kept the high offices of state exclusively in their
hands. By this time the censors drew up the senate-lists chiefly from
the ranks of ex-magistrates, and the magistracies became a graduated
course. It required extraordinary pushfulness or wealth or patronage for
a new man to insinuate himself into the charmed circle. The old
patriciate had gone, politically at least, and only survived for
religious purposes, but Rome still remained a thrall to aristocracy of a
far more dangerous type, an aristocracy of office. One of the troubles
of Rome lay in the fact that this aristocracy was daily becoming less
warlike and less competent.</p>

<p>A great deal of nonsense has been talked about the luxury of the Romans
as one of the causes of their decline. Even Mommsen relates with shocked
emotion that they imported anchovies from the Black Sea and wine from
Greece. Two hot meals a day they had and “frivolous articles” including
bronze-mounted couches. There were professional cooks, and actually
bakers’ shops began to appear about 171 <small>B.C.</small> It is true that all this
luxury would pale into insignificance before the modern artisan’s
breakfast-table with bread from Russia, bacon from America, tea from
Ceylon or coffee from Brazil, sugar from Jamaica, and eggs from Denmark.
Cato would have swooned at the sight of our picture-frames coated with
real gold, for he publicly stigmatised a senator who had £30 worth of
silver plate. The truth is that Rome having grown rich was just
beginning to grow civilised. It is the everlasting misfortune of Rome
that events occurred in that order.</p>

<p>In conquering Macedon Rome had become acquainted with civilisation. At
that date civilisation meant Hellenism slightly tinctured with
Orientalism, a culture which, though still alive and still original and
creative, was certainly past its prime. The Hellenistic period of Greek
art has been unjustly<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_73" id="page_73">{73}</a></span> depreciated in comparison with the more youthful
and virile age of Pericles. But it could still boast of great scholars,
scientists, and philosophers, both at Alexandria and Athens. Theocritus,
Bion, and Moschus form a group of original poets who are really great,
and an art that could produce the lovely Aphrodite of Melos cannot with
justice be termed decadent. Politically, morally, and physically Greece
was no doubt long past the vigour of her youth, but intellectually she
was still well qualified to play the part of schoolmistress to the lusty
young barbarian of the West. We have seen that in very remote times Rome
had come under Etruscan influences which were closely akin to Greek.
There had been some interchange, if tradition may be trusted, of Greek
and Etruscan art and artists. Greek painters had worked in Rome at a
very early date. Then came perhaps two centuries of relapse in the
cultural sense while Rome was busy with warfare and conquest. In 300
<small>B.C</small>. she was almost entirely destitute of accomplishments, and even, if
we may except law, politics, and military skill, of civilisation. The
war with Pyrrhus, the conquest of Tarentum and then of Sicily brought in
Greek slaves, and semi-Greek South-Italian citizens who were bound to
have some influence. Then came direct dealings with Greece in the three
Macedonian wars, and every Roman who had fought with Flamininus or
Paulus returned to Rome if not an apostle of culture at any rate a man
who had seen civilisation with his own eyes and could no longer regard
old Roman ways as sufficient for man’s happiness. How could eyes that
had seen the Zeus of Pheidias at Olympia glowing with ivory and gold be
content with the old vermilion Jove of his native temple?</p>

<p>Nevertheless it was very slowly that culture filtered in. All through
the third century and for the first half of the second Rome was still
incessantly occupied with war. Her tastes were brutalised and
demoralised by it. When drama painfully began, the dramatists sadly
lamented that their audiences would desert the theatre for the sight of
a rope-<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_74" id="page_74">{74}</a></span>dancer or a beast-baiting or, better still, a pair of
gladiators. From the first it was vain to attempt the creation of a
national drama for a people whose craving was for the sight of blood.
Gladiatoral combats are said to have been of Etruscan origin. They first
appeared at Rome in the early part of the third century in connection
with funeral displays. From every African expedition wild beasts were
brought home to be slaughtered in the Roman amphitheatres. These bloody
shows indicate the real tastes of the Romans from the earliest times.
They are no spurious growth of the so-called “degenerate Empire.” On one
occasion, when the music of some Greek flute-players failed to please a
Roman audience, the presiding magistrate ordered the unlucky artists to
fight one another, and the hoots of the crowd were instantly transformed
to rapturous applause.</p>

<p>All the arts were held in contempt, all were entrusted to slaves or the
poorest kind of citizens. Thus Hellenic civilisation was transported to
Rome under a double disadvantage. Not only was Greek civilisation itself
already past its prime, but it was interpreted largely by slaves. Every
Roman of position had Greeks among his retinue&mdash;not, of course, the
citizens of famous cities like Athens or Alexandria, which were still
free, but low-caste, half-barbarian wretches from the great market at
Delos or from the southern towns of Italy&mdash;for clerks, accountants,
scribes, jesters, procurers, physicians, pedagogues, flute-players,
philosophers, cooks, concubines, and schoolmasters. We may be sure that
it was not the most favourable type of Hellenism that would creep into
Rome by such channels as these. But it was precisely in this manner that
Roman literature began. The noble general M. Livius Salinator brought
from Tarentum in about 275 <small>B.C.</small> a Greek slave named Andronikos, as a
tutor for his sons. This man received his liberty, and as Livius
Andronicus set up a school. For his school he required books, and as
there was no other text-book in Latin but the XII Tables, he undertook
the translation of Homer’s Odyssey into the native<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_75" id="page_75">{75}</a></span> Italian measure of
Saturnian verse. His work was, of course, very indifferently performed,
but it remained a primer of education down to the schooldays of Horace.
Emboldened by this success he proceeded to supply the Roman stage with
translations of Greek tragedies.</p>

<p>Such was the beginning; the sequel was not much more promising. Nævius
was a Campanian who translated Greek comedies and tragedies. In the
former he attempted the old Greek custom of political allusions, but
speedily found that there was no such liberty of speech in Rome as had
prevailed in the palmy days of Athenian comedy. An allusion to the
Metellus family brought the famous and thoroughly old Roman poetical
retort:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">dabunt malum Metelli Nævio poetæ,<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">and was fulfilled by the imprisonment of the dramatist. Thus the
beginnings of literature at Rome were by no means easy. The dramatists
were hampered by severe police restrictions as well as by the barbarity
of their public. It is interesting to note that both these poets also
attempted the epic style. Livius Andronicus was actually commissioned by
the priests to celebrate the victory of Sena in verse, and Nævius wrote
an account of the First Punic War.</p>

<p>For comedy the Romans appear to have had some natural taste. It seems
that a very rude and barbaric form of dramatic dialogue mixed with
buffoonery was native to Italy in the Fescennine Songs, though even
these are said to have been of Etruscan invention. So the Romans at
their festivals were content to listen to comedies if the humour was
obvious enough, if there was plenty of horseplay. The setting was
wretched indeed. Instead of the magnificent marble theatres of Greece,
wooden booths were temporarily erected in the amphitheatre, and a noisy
disorderly audience listened with good-humoured contempt to the efforts
of the actors who tried to amuse them. Sometimes the chorus would be
sung by trained musicians, while the actors on the stage illustrated the
inaudible words by<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_76" id="page_76">{76}</a></span> pantomimic gestures. It was utterly crude and
inartistic from beginning to end, and in deplorable contrast to the
beginnings of Drama in Greece. There it had been a national service of
worship to the gods. Here it was a trivial amusement in the hands of
slaves and foreigners.</p>

<p>Of the three great comedians, Plautus, though a genuine free Italian of
Umbria, had been reduced by poverty to the position almost of a slave;
Cæcilius was a prisoner of war from the neighbourhood of Milan, who had
been brought to Rome as a slave and then set free; Terence was a
Carthaginian by birth, belonging as a slave to the Senator Terentius
Lucanus, and subsequently being liberated became a friend of the younger
Scipio. Ennius, the “father” of epic verse and tragedy, was a client of
the elder Scipio and a Greek-speaking Calabrian by birth. Pacuvius, the
best of the early tragedians, was a native of Brundisium, and therefore
more Greek than Roman; he too belonged to the Scipionic circle. The
activity of these writers belongs mainly to the first half of the second
century. Not one of them was a Roman by origin, still less was there
anything distinctively Roman in their work. Except from the linguistic
point of view there is little to be said about any of them. The comic
dramatists were engaged in translating the work of the Greek comedians
of the third phase, especially Menander and Philemon. To meet the demand
for more plot, more action, with less dialogue and less poetry, they
would generally make a patchwork of two or three Greek plays. From the
artistic point of view the work was clumsily done. There was little
pretence of Romanising the characters or the scenes, generally they were
frankly Greek with strange intrusions from Roman life. The source from
which they drew was by now a stereotyped comedy of manners with stock
characters&mdash;the heavy father, either an indulgent debauchee or a stingy
curmudgeon; the old woman, generally a procuress; the gay and profligate
young hero; the fair heroine, generally a <i>meretrix</i>, and a background
of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_77" id="page_77">{77}</a></span> parasites, bullies, pandars, slave-dealers, and scoundrelly slaves,
who came in for recurrent beatings to the great entertainment of the
audience. The situations are also “taken from stock,” facial
resemblances, disguised strangers, mistaken identities, veiled women and
so forth. The “love interest,” such as it is, almost invariably centres
round the desire of a young profligate for a courtesan. The atmosphere
is generally brutal and immoral. There is often a ludicrous want of
dramatic imagination in the stage management. Yet the comedies of
Plautus and Terence have played a larger part in monasteries and
schoolrooms than any other literature in the world, and through
Shakespeare and Molière have had a decisive influence in the history of
the drama. We do not possess enough of the original Greek sources to say
very definitely how much was contributed by the Roman dramatists of
their own. Where we do get passages for comparison the Latin version has
generally lost a great deal in wit and neatness of expression. The
prologues, so far as they are genuine, are at any rate in the case of
Plautus extremely bald and crude. “Now I will tell you why I have come
forward here and what I intend in order that you may know the name of
this play. For so far as the story goes it is a short one. Now I will
tell you what I was anxious to inform you of: the name of this play in
Greek is <i>Onagos</i>&mdash;Demophilus (or Diphilus?) composed it, Maccius turned
it into Latin. He wishes it called <i>Asinaria</i>, if you please.” And so he
proceeds to unwind his plot and relate how the young spendthrift
Argyrripus won the favours of the courtesan Philenium by duping her
mother, the procuress, and cheating <i>his</i> mother, a shrew, out of twenty
minæ by the co-operation of his immoral old father who hoped to secure
the young woman for himself.</p>

<p>It would be wrong, however, to underrate the literary merits of Plautus
and Terence. These authors reveal to us something of the natural speech
of the Roman&mdash;Plautus in particular, for Terence is already far more
“classical” in his language. It is not always easy to say how far the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_78" id="page_78">{78}</a></span>
amusement which we get from them is legitimate, or how far it is
laughter at the expense of their antique artlessness and clumsiness. But
Plautus has a rich vein of simple humour and an irresistible sly appeal
to his audience which often makes one unconscious of the garbage in
which he is dealing. Terence has a polish, a graceful way of putting the
obvious, and a purity of diction which sometimes makes his young men
seem almost gentlemen and his young women almost virtuous. There is a
great deal of sound worldly morality in Terence and some pure sentiment.
But it is necessary here to lay stress upon the fact that the literary
arts of Rome never possessed the fresh innocence or even the simple
coarseness of youth. It was little harm, perhaps, that the gladiators,
the rope-dancers, the bear-baiters, and the charioteers won the day in
the affections of Roman audiences.</p>

<p>Father Ennius, too, in his tragedies was little more than a translator.
He was employed consciously by the great Scipio to educate and broaden
the Roman taste. He had learnt of the Greek philosophers to disbelieve
in the gods, or rather he had learnt the deadly Euhemerist doctrine that
the gods of Olympus are but the memories of long dead human heroes, or
that they sit, as Epicurus also taught,</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">“On the hills ... together careless of mankind.”<br /></span>

<span class="iq">“ego deum genus esse dixi et dicam semper cælitum,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">nam si curent, bene bonis sit, male malis, quod nunc abest.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>At the age of fifty Ennius set himself to relate the whole of Roman
history in eighteen books of epic verse. No one claims for him the rank
of a great poet, but he shaped for Vergil’s hand that magnificent
instrument the Latin hexameter, and many scholars believe that he
vitally affected the literary language of Rome by preserving the
terminal inflexions which were dropping out of current speech. All the
fragments of Ennius that have survived, though often rough and ugly, yet
possess a massive dignity of their own,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_79" id="page_79">{79}</a></span> and often a most solemn majesty
of cadence, as in the lines with which I have headed this chapter. But
here again we must notice that the rugged father of Latin poetry had
already taken over the scepticism of the declining religion of Greece.</p>

<p>For many generations now Roman religion had been losing its native
character and becoming cosmopolitan and denationalised. As we have seen,
its genuinely native elements were mainly rural and now the Roman was a
townsman with a townsman’s light scepticism and craving for novelty and
sensation. Jupiter and Minerva and the other high gods had from the
first been largely foreigners; at any rate few discernibly Latin ideas
appear in the cults or personalities. As early as 204 <small>B.C.</small>, that is, in
the throes of the Great Punic War, the worship of Cybele&mdash;the Great
Mother of Phrygian ritual&mdash;had been introduced along with its begging
eunuch priests. Apollo with appropriate athletic games had arrived a few
years earlier. New gods multiplied, old gods became hellenised, Roman
priesthoods became more and more political, being simply obtained by
popular election like any other public office, or crack dining-clubs for
the aristocracy. As the gods multiplied faith declined. In 186 <small>B.C.</small> the
Senate discovered a whole system of secret nocturnal orgies which under
the name of Bacchic mysteries had spread with extraordinary rapidity
throughout Italy. Ten thousand men were arrested and condemned, mostly
to death, but the associations flourished unchecked.</p>

<p>Morality, public and private, was equally unsound. Publicly we have
sufficient stories of bribery by candidates for office&mdash;not to mention
the systematic corruption of the electorate by corn-doles and shows&mdash;to
prove that political uncleanness was of very old standing in Rome. As
for private virtue it may be that the world of pimps and prostitutes
which flits across the Plautine stage is borrowed from Athens, but it
was certainly familiar at Rome and rapidly domesticated itself. Slavery
had always existed there, and immorality is<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_80" id="page_80">{80}</a></span> inseparable from slavery.
Now with a mob of retired soldiers gathered promiscuously and without
employment in the capital immorality was multiplied in every class. As
early as 234 <small>B.C.</small> there was public complaint of the unwillingness of the
Roman men of good family to face the responsibilities of marriage.
Already, as in the case of C. Calpurnius Piso, there were horrible
domestic tragedies in great houses. Divorce was already common. As usual
the Pharisees of the day strove to combat immorality with prudishness.
Cato the Censor punished a Roman senator for kissing his wife in the
presence of their daughter.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now, let it be remembered that this very age of which we are speaking,
the age of conquest in the Punic and Greek wars, is the heroic age of
Roman history, the age to which poets and historians of the empire
looked back as golden. We do not rely upon satirists or gossip-dealers
for this gloomy picture of Rome in her palmy days. The facts upon which
it is based are beyond dispute. What inference are we to draw? Reviewing
those facts and especially noticing the dates, we see that all the
vicious features of Roman society, the cruelty, the idleness, the
debauchery, the political corruption, the lack of artistic taste, the
immorality and crime in the noble houses, the injustice and oppression
of the poor and helpless, are no products of the Empire, but deeply
engrained in the Roman character and entwined about the roots of her
history. In our pursuit of old Roman virtue we may go to the furthest
bounds of historical record in vain. No doubt, before Rome began to be a
city and long before she began to have a history, there were simple
laborious rustics on the Latin plains, who possessed, for want of
opportunity, the virtuous abstinences of the poor. But it is manifestly
false to ascribe degeneration either to the fall of the Republican
system of government or to the introduction of civilisation. If one
cause more than another is to be assigned for the rapid growth of evil
tendencies it is the exhaustion<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_81" id="page_81">{81}</a></span> consequent upon incessant warfare and
the brutality engendered by continual life in camp. The only thing that
could mitigate the latter was surely education and culture. Instead,
then, of Greek civilisation being the cause of degeneracy at Rome we may
more truthfully assert that it came to save her from ruin at a time when
she was threatened with internal decay. Had it come earlier or been
accepted more willingly it might have done more to brighten the darker
pages of Roman history. It was their starved souls, empty of ideals,
devoid even of reasonable occupation for their leisure or harmless use
for their wealth, which rendered the aristocracy of Rome so utterly
vulgar and debased.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_82" id="page_82">{82}</a></span></p>

/></span>HERE is no doubt that many of the disquieting symptoms
which we have just noted as afflicting Roman society in the second
century <small>B.C.</small> might have been allayed, and possibly even the causes
removed, by a wise and foreseeing government. In dealing with the allies
and subjects who formed her vast and growing empire any modern
politician could have told the senate that they had to choose one of two
courses&mdash;either centralisation or devolution of power, either a just and
firm system of control or a liberal grant of autonomous rights. But the
senate had no policy. It left things to shape themselves. Again, the
agrarian difficulty of a deserted countryside and an idle, disorderly
city proletariat could easily have been solved if it had been taken
early, before the habit of city-life grew upon the discharged warriors.
Again the senate did nothing till it was too late. Then, having acquired
an overseas empire all over the Mediterranean, the senate, if it had not
been blind, should have seen that it was necessary to maintain a strong
navy and police the seas in the interests of commerce. But again the
government neglected its duty. For these and many other sins of
negligence there was a heavy reckoning to be paid. It required no oracle
to foretell disaster.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_83" id="page_83">{83}</a></span></p>

<p>While the mass of the senate sat by inert and helpless, allowing the
helm of state to sway from side to side in their nerveless fingers, two
small parties in the state had policies of their own. There was Cato (it
is difficult to find a party for him to lead), who believed that by
repeating the mystic words <i>mos maiorum</i> he could put the clock back to
the days of Cincinnatus, if not of Numa, mistaking symptoms for diseases
and hoping, like many another revivalist, to make people virtuous by
making them uncomfortable, a task doomed to failure from the start.</p>

<p>Over against these were set a party who may almost be termed liberals,
in that they were prepared to go forward hopefully in company with the
spirit of their age. Their foremost representatives were the Scipios,
who acted as patrons to many of the literary circle we have just
described, and were themselves eager to accept the new culture.
Unfortunately there was very little wisdom or foresight among them, and,
above all, there was an aristocratic pride which would have rendered
them impossible as leaders even if they had had any idea of a
destination. As a family the Scipios were by no means uniformly
competent, and most of them subsisted on the glamour of the name, which
itself had been very largely due to the good luck and opportunity of
Scipio Africanus, the Elder and the Younger.</p>

<p>The special feature which distinguishes the age which we have now to
consider&mdash;that is, roughly, the hundred years from 146 <small>B.C.</small> onwards&mdash;is
that the historian’s attention now begins to be focussed on a series of
personal biographies. One might almost say it is already clear that some
individual must dominate this ill-constructed imperial city, and the
only question left is who it shall be. In the true polity of the
city-state the influence of personality is reduced to a minimum, and
various devices, such as the lot at Athens or the double and annual
consulship at Rome, are employed to prevent that individual predominance
which so easily turns to despotism. It is not due so much to envy as to
an instinct<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_84" id="page_84">{84}</a></span> of self-preservation that republics are notoriously
ungrateful to their great men. But personal eminence, if it is dangerous
to the liberty of a republic, is almost essential to the government of a
great empire and the control of huge armies. The incompetence of the
annual generals, now that warfare was on a large scale and conducted far
from the overseeing eye of the administration, became more noticeable.
Already in the Third Macedonian War it had been disgracefully apparent.
Now the long campaigns against Viriathus in Spain and Jugurtha in Africa
reveal pitiful ineptitude, coupled with shameless dishonesty, in the
republican generals of the aristocracy. Roman armies are no longer
invincible in the field, they are not even disciplined.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Gracchi</span></h3>

<p>But first we have to recall a futile attempt at reform of the economic
distresses of the imperial city. It is not so much the actual schemes of
the brothers Gracchus which interest us&mdash;for the schemes themselves were
unworkable and contained as much folly as wisdom&mdash;as the manner in which
reform was proposed and defeated. The Gracchi themselves, though of
plebeian origin, belonged by numerous ties to the liberal aristocracy.
Their famous mother, Cornelia&mdash;one of the many Roman women who by their
influence help to make Roman history so different from Greek&mdash;was the
daughter of Scipio Africanus. Tiberius, the elder brother, was married
to a Claudia; among his friends were Scævola and Crassus. Thus on all
sides he belonged to the circle of progressive nobles. His education had
been such as one would expect from such surroundings. As their father
had died at an early age, it was Cornelia’s task to make her two
“jewels” worthy of her glorious name. Accordingly she employed the most
eminent Greeks for their tutors. The boys were trained, no doubt, in
Greek oratory to declaim in praise of liberty and tyrannicides, in Greek
history and political science to divide constitutions up into
monarchies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_85" id="page_85">{85}</a></span> aristocracies, and democracies, and to believe that in the
latter all power belongs to the people. At the same time their military
training was not neglected; in horsemanship and feats of arms they
outshone all their comrades. Their prospects were in every way brilliant
and hopeful. While still a youth of about sixteen, Tiberius was elected
augur. The proud aristocrat, Appius Claudius, as it is related by
Plutarch, offered him the hand of his daughter, and, having secured it,
rushed home to announce her betrothal. As soon as his wife heard of it
she exclaimed: “Why in such a hurry unless you have got Tiberius
Gracchus for our daughter?” It is the misfortune of rhetorical history
that all its good characters appear to be prigs and all its bad ones
scoundrels; but it is certain that if Tiberius had been content with the
easy road to fame which stretched before him in youth, he might without
trouble have had the world at his feet. He accompanied his
brother-in-law, the younger Africanus, in the last expedition against
Carthage. In camp he was the most distinguished of the young officers,
and the first to scale the walls of the city. He served his quæstorship
in Spain, and there showed all the diplomatic skill of the Cornelian
family. He saved an army of 20,000 men from destruction at Numantia. The
Spaniards loved him no less for his name than for his uprightness. Thus
at the age of thirty-one he had his future assured. A brilliant orator
with distinguished public service behind him, he was obviously destined
for the consulship in the near future, and then for a huge province, for
wealth, fame, and honour.</p>

<p>Call him a prig and a doctrinaire, if you will, for not being content
with that prospect. In passing through, on his way to Spain, he had seen
the pleasant lands of Tuscany lying forlorn and desolate, chained gangs
of foreign slaves working in the fields or tending the flocks of
absentee Roman landlords, while the sturdy peasants who should have been
in their place were loafing in the streets of Rome. The public land,
conquered in war, had sometimes been simply embezzled<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_86" id="page_86">{86}</a></span> by Roman
politicians; sometimes granted to veteran soldiers only to fall into the
hands of speculators. The old Licinian land-law, which had limited the
amount of land which might be held in one hand, was openly flouted, and
leases were treated as freeholds.</p>

<p>Seeing these things, the young man was filled with a passion for reform,
and deliberately devoted his life to that task. The modern historians
who call him prig and demagogue do not deny the awful mischief which he
set himself to repair. It is hard to know what he should have done to
please them. The senate, by now an entrenched stronghold of property
dishonestly acquired and privilege dishonestly maintained, could
obviously never be converted. Filled with Greek ideas, Tiberius
determined to appeal to the <i>demos</i>. That of course was a mistake. There
was no such thing as a <i>demos</i> at Rome, and there never had been. The
relation between Senate and Comitia was not in the least the same as
that between Council and Assembly in Greece. At Rome the Senate
deliberated and the Comitia ratified; at Athens the Council prepared
business for the Assembly to discuss and decide. It is not that the
letter of the constitution really matters&mdash;when people are hungry it
does not&mdash;but that there was lacking at Rome the very elements of
democracy, an articulate commons, an organised will of the people.
Failing that, any attempt to pose as champion of the people must be a
fraud, conscious or unconscious. But it is grossly unfair to Gracchus to
suppose that it was conscious. He thought that he was living in a
democracy, he thought that a tribune of the plebs might fairly claim to
be champion of the people, unaware that the plebs was now an
anachronism, and the tribunate merely a clumsy brake on the wheels of
the state. In 133 <small>B.C</small>. Tiberius had himself elected as one of the ten
tribunes, and immediately prepared to introduce the millennium by
legislative process.</p>

<p>He proposed to enforce the old Licinian laws by which no individual
citizen could claim a large holding of public<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_87" id="page_87">{87}</a></span> land. Then presently, in
his childlike ignorance of the tenacity of property, annoyed at the
resistance he encountered, he further proposed to make his measure
retrospective, so as to evict thousands of noble land-grabbers. The land
thus escheated to the state he proposed to lease on nominal terms as
small holdings to the poorer citizens of Rome. The distribution was to
be carried out by a commission of three. Very unwisely, but probably
because there were no men of standing in the senate whom he could trust,
he made this commission a family party consisting of himself, his
father-in-law, and his young brother. Property was immediately up in
arms against him. The liberal senators discovered, as even liberals are
apt to do, that one’s own property has a sanctity far superior to other
people’s. Accordingly, they took the Roman constitutional method of
putting up another tribune to veto the proposals of Tiberius. Thereupon
Tiberius, with his fantastic notions of the people and the people’s
rights, declared that a tribune who opposed the people was no tribune,
and so had Octavius deposed. The senate’s answer was the only
constitutional answer left to them, a threat of prosecution when the
tribunate should be over. That, of course, made it necessary for
Tiberius to perpetuate his office. He gathered a band of followers sworn
to protect his life, proposed a string of attractive measures to secure
popular support, and stood for a second term of office. The senate put
up more tribunes to veto his election. Thus the state was at a deadlock;
there were no more resources for such a situation within constitutional
limits, so the senators simply girt up their togas and, led by a Scipio,
marched down into the forum to settle the question of reform in a truly
Roman manner. Tiberius Gracchus was murdered, and his followers left for
judicial assassination.</p>

<p>Ten years later Gaius Gracchus, with a similar programme and the added
motive of piety to his brother’s memory, took up the campaign afresh.
The senate, indeed, having slain the author of reform, had been forced
to allow the reforms<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_88" id="page_88">{88}</a></span> themselves at any rate to start. Some lands had
been redistributed, and when another Scipio got a decree passed to stop
the work of the land commission, he too was assassinated. It is clear
that by this time the agrarian agitation had been largely appeased; what
follows is political merely. The reformers had got the constitution
altered to permit the re-election of tribunes, and in 123 Gaius was
elected to that office; he was rather more practical, and therefore far
more dangerous, than his brother, but the passion for vengeance against
the stubborn and brutal nobility had no doubt blinded his judgment.
Coupled with the land-agitation there was now a loud demand for
political rights by the Italians, who were debarred even from the
elementary rights of market and marriage with each other.</p>

<p>The platform upon which Gaius Gracchus stood was a radical one.
Henceforth every poor citizen was to be supplied with cheap corn at less
than half price, about 4<i>d.</i> a bushel. The land commission was to be
restored. The Assembly was to be reorganised upon a new basis, which
would destroy the preponderant voting power of the nobility. New
colonies were to be founded, including one at Carthage&mdash;a most salutary
measure. Easier terms of military service were to be granted, including
free equipment and the right of appeal. By these measures, some of them
wise and just, some of them mere vote-catching devices, Gaius won the
support of the people. Then he turned to the second estate&mdash;the
capitalist Equites. To buy their favour he took up their demand that the
taxes of “Asia,” as the Romans called their new province bequeathed to
them by King Attalus III., should be put up for auction not locally but
in Rome. It seemed to the Romans that since the Asiatics were bound to
be plundered in any case, as indeed the inhabitants of Asia Minor always
had and always have been plundered, the proceeds might as well flow
straight into the pockets of Roman capitalists. To this he added the
proposition that the jury-lists should henceforth be drawn from the
Equestrian order and the senators excluded.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_89" id="page_89">{89}</a></span> It was probably more
iniquitous that money-lenders and governors should be tried by a jury of
money-lenders exclusively than that they should come before a jury of
governors past and future. Neither would seem to us or to the
provincials an ideal arrangement.</p>

</div>

<p>Much of this policy, we have to admit, was pure demagogy, but for that
the conservative nobles, who cared nothing for the welfare of the state,
and were impervious to anything but force, are directly responsible.
Gracchus got his measures through the comitia, and secured his
re-election for the next year. Feeling that his policy had secured him a
large and faithful party of supporters, he now prepared to introduce a
measure which he knew to be necessary for the salvation of his country,
but which he must equally well have known to be unpopular at Rome,
namely, the grant of citizen rights to the Italians. By this we see that
Gaius Gracchus, if he sometimes stooped to the arts of the demagogue,
was also capable of real statesmanship. The progressive grant of burgess
rights as soon as subject peoples were sufficiently Romanised to be fit
for them was the old Roman policy, which had made the city great in the
past, and kept her safe in the shock of invasion. But the Romans had now
become jealous and exclusive. The proposal was detested in Rome. Each
side organised its gangs of roughs; there were daily riots in the
streets, and at last the senatorial party once more charged down into
the forum and slaughtered the second reformer as they had slaughtered
the first. In the prosecutions that followed no fewer than 3000 of his
partisans were executed.</p>

<p>In all this it is evident that the Roman political system had completely
broken down. The constitution had always been incredibly ill-defined.
There is no doubt that sovereignty legally belonged to the people, and
that senatorial government was a usurpation, as the Gracchi called it.
By calling the citizen body of Rome a mob or a rabble you do not alter
the rights of the case. It was largely the fault of the Government that
they had been allowed to become so selfish, so disorderly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_90" id="page_90">{90}</a></span> and so
corrupt. The extraordinary machinery of the tribunate&mdash;ten magistrates,
each with an absolute veto upon all government&mdash;had made it impossible
to find any constitutional method of reform. The policy of Gaius
Gracchus was the only possible one if Rome was to be saved, and as a
matter of plain fact it was the policy which after a century of
unceasing bloodshed Rome eventually adopted. It was to be a disguised
monarchy, like that of Pericles at Athens, working on the basis of the
tribunician powers. The old ascendancy of the Senate could not stand a
challenge; not only did it rest upon no legal title, but it had lost
whatever claim to respect it ever possessed on the score of patriotism
or statesmanship. For the agrarian problem it had no policy but to hold
fast to its ill-gotten lands; to the demands of the Italian allies it
had nothing but a miserly “no.” It watched with indifference the ruin of
Italy, the degeneracy of Rome, and the oppression of the provincial
world. The policy of the Gracchi may have included dreams and
nightmares, but it did look forward and hold out hopes. The Gracchi had
now definitely started a party system. They had laid the foundation of a
democratic movement, and it is Rome’s misfortune that this foundation
was built of such rotten materials. The democracy had been bought by
bribes, but it had failed to exhibit a spark of disinterested
statesmanship. If ever a state needed a master that state was Rome.
Henceforth until a master came the condition of Rome and Italy and the
provinces was simply deplorable. Nothing could be done in politics
without a hired gang of bravos.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Marius</span></h3>

<p>The next conspicuous attempt at reform comes from a genuine son of the
people, one of the very few peasants who emerge into the light of
history at Rome. In the wretchedly mismanaged Jugurthan war Gaius Marius
had shouldered his way to the front by sheer courage and capacity for
war through a crowd of cowardly and incompetent aristocrats, who almost
openly trafficked with the foreign enemy of Rome. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_91" id="page_91">{91}</a></span> course of this
business requires a brief sketch if we are to understand the condition
of Roman government at this period.</p>

<p>The king of the client state of Numidia dying divided his realm between
two legitimate sons and one illegitimate, the latter being Jugurtha.
This amiable bastard straightway murdered one of his brothers and
attacked the other, who fled to the Roman province and appealed to the
senate for protection. Jugurtha, already knowing the ropes of senatorial
policy, sent envoys with well-filled purses, and easily convinced the
senate of his innocence and good intentions. The senate decided to send
out a commission to divide the kingdom equitably between Jugurtha and
his half-brother. The result of its labours was that Adherbal got the
desert and the capital, while Jugurtha got all the fertile part of the
country, and the commission returned home rich and happy. Jugurtha had
now only to obtain the capital, but as Adherbal refused to fight and
kept appealing to Rome, there was nothing for it but to besiege Cirta.
Numerous envoys came to Jugurtha from the senate in the course of the
siege, but he easily assured them of his pacific intentions. As soon as
he had taken the city he put his rival to death with torture, and
massacred the entire male population, including a great number of
Italian and Roman citizens.</p>

<p>The senate did not feel that this course of action was entirely
meritorious, but it required the stimulus of a democratic agitation and
another troublesome tribune to induce them to declare war. The senate
sent out two of its best men in Bestia and Scaurus; the latter
especially was generally reputed to be a veritable Aristides, for he had
ventured to protest against the former iniquities. When the Roman army
arrived, Jugurtha knew better ways than fighting. He submitted at
discretion, surrendered the Roman deserters, whom of course he did not
want to keep, and a few elephants, which he soon afterwards repurchased
privately. In return he was permitted to retain his kingdom. Once more
there were<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_92" id="page_92">{92}</a></span> outcries at Rome, voiced by the same democratic tribune
Memmius, who insisted that Jugurtha should be summoned to Rome to answer
for his sins. Meekly but with bulging moneybags Jugurtha arrived. As
soon as Memmius began to cross-examine him another tribune interposed
his veto. During his visit Jugurtha was able to purchase a strong party
in the senate; he also had time to procure the assassination of an
obnoxious fellow-countryman in the city itself. This outrage, combined
with the ambition of the new consul, Spurius Albinus, led to another
declaration of war, Jugurtha himself being allowed to go home and
prepare for it. As he departed he uttered the famous words, “Ah, Rome!
Venal city! She would sell herself if she could find a purchaser.”</p>

<p>When Albinus led out the second army, he found it utterly incapable of
fighting. It was a band of cowardly brigands, who spent their time in
plundering their own province; and when the consul’s brother conceived
the spirited project of seizing the king’s treasury for himself, instead
of waiting for the more tedious and uncertain profits of bribery, he led
the Roman army into an ambush. It surrendered readily. It was forced to
go under the yoke, and agree to evacuate all Numidia.</p>

<p>This was a little too much. Another tribune&mdash;in all this period we
observe the tribunes acting as the heads of popular opposition quite in
the Gracchan manner&mdash;proposed a special inquiry to investigate the
matter, and bring the offenders to justice. Three of the worst&mdash;Spurius
Albinus, Bestia, and L. Opimius, the destroyer of G. Gracchus&mdash;were
banished, but the incorruptible Scaurus escaped condemnation by sitting
on the bench. The treaty of peace was cancelled, and its
author&mdash;following the usual Roman custom when armies in awkward places
surrendered&mdash;was given up to the enemy.</p>

<p>In the third campaign the senate really tried to do its best. Q.
Metellus, the new general, belonged to the party of liberal nobles who
were in favour of moderate reform. He began<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_93" id="page_93">{93}</a></span> well by choosing his
officers for military skill&mdash;somewhat of an innovation. Among others he
chose a brave young farmer, G. Marius. Arrived in Africa, Metellus had
first to reduce the Roman army to order, and then, having failed to get
his enemy assassinated, marched out to fight him. Jugurtha was beaten in
battle (for the Roman army could still fight under decent leadership),
and henceforth was driven to guerilla warfare, in which he displayed
such remarkable skill that the war soon came to a standstill.</p>

<p>At this point G. Marius, who had achieved popularity and renown through
his valour, conceived the ambitious plan of standing for the consulship.
It is hard to guess how such an audacious idea can have entered his
head, for such an application from a man of no family was entirely
without precedent. Somebody at Rome must have whispered the idea. When
he asked his consul for permission to go to Rome for the purpose,
Metellus was vastly diverted, and suggested that Marius had better wait
until his general’s little boy was grown up, in order that he might have
a Metellus for a colleague. Probably Marius had little sense of humour,
for he did go to Rome, just in time, and was elected consul. Moreover, a
special decree entrusted him with command of the army in Africa.</p>

<p>Among his officers was the young legate, L. Cornelius Sulla, and though
Marius undoubtedly displayed vigour and competence, it was very largely
the luck and diplomacy of Sulla which procured the seizure and surrender
of the Numidian king. Marius, however, reaped the glory. Jugurtha graced
his triumph (104 <small>B.C.</small>), and soon afterwards perished in a Roman dungeon.</p>

<p>Simultaneously with the Jugurthan war the Romans were called upon to
face a far more serious affair, one of those great folk-wanderings from
the north which occur periodically in the course of Mediterranean
history. The Cimbri and Teutons, who may have numbered ancestors of our
own among them, came down from the shores of the Baltic, travelling with
their households in a train of waggons which took six days in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_94" id="page_94">{94}</a></span> defiling
past the onlooker. These barbarians were terrible to the Romans, with
their strange aspect, their long iron swords and savage war-cries, their
fair hair and giant stature. But of course they were savages compared to
the Romans, and they should never have inflicted more than one defeat on
intelligent generals of disciplined armies. As it was, they had to face
mutinous legions and incompetent consuls. First they defeated Carbo and
overran Gaul; then coming south into the province they beat Silanus and
Scaurus; and then, united with the Helvetians, they inflicted a
frightful disaster on Longinus, when a Roman legate had to surrender,
and another Roman army was sent under the yoke. In 105 a worse thing
happened: the great defeat of Arausio (Orange) seemed more fatal even
than Cannæ in the extent of its losses. There was a panic in Italy,
which seemed helplessly exposed to the fury of the northmen, but
fortunately the aimless barbarians wandered off into the west and spent
their strength on the warlike Spanish tribes.</p>

<p>As before, popular indignation at Rome, diverted from the real cause of
the mischief, the rotten system of cliques which governed them, wasted
its fury on individuals. Senators were mobbed and stoned. A proconsul
was actually deposed from office. There was only one man deemed capable
of dealing with the peril&mdash;Marius, the man of the people, the triumphant
conqueror of Jugurtha. So, despite laws forbidding re-election, Marius
became consul for a second time and a third&mdash;five times consul. This was
symptomatic of a changed Rome. It was, however, necessary. Amateur
generals had had a long trial. From 104 to 100 Marius was continuously
chief magistrate of the state, as well as generalissimo of its armies.
He did his work. First he had to get his army in hand, and accustom them
to the sight of the terrible barbarians. Then he dealt two smashing
blows at the Teutons and Cimbri near Aquæ Sextiæ and on the Raudine
Plain. It was the misfortune of the Roman system of imperium that no
general could attain to eminence in war without at the same time
acquiring<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_95" id="page_95">{95}</a></span> political importance. Hence Marius in 100 <small>B.C.</small> found himself
absolutely first in the Roman state without education or even common
sense in politics. He presents a pathetic figure in the turbulent world
of Roman statecraft, a war-scarred veteran, the indubitable saviour of
Rome, called upon to play the part of a statesman, and yet a mere puppet
in the hands of unscrupulous intriguers. First he fell into the hands of
two shameless demagogues&mdash;Saturninus and Glaucia&mdash;who used him to revive
the Gracchan revolution. Marius became consul for the sixth time, and a
new reform programme was drawn up, including an agrarian law to divide
the land conquered from the Cimbri, and incidentally all the land they
had conquered, into small holdings for the Marian veterans, Latins and
Italians alike. Marius was to have personal charge of the distribution,
and this task would make him master of Rome for many years to come.
Secondly, there was to be a still further cheapening of corn; and,
thirdly, new colonies were to be founded and the Italian allies to have
a share in them. Of course there was violent opposition. The senate
tried all its old stratagems, tribunician veto, portents, and lastly
bludgeons. To meet the latter, Marius whistled his veteran soldiers to
his side, and the “Appuleian Laws” were carried, with the addition of a
very obnoxious clause that each senator was to take an oath of
allegiance to the new legislation within five days on pain of forfeiting
his seat. Q. Metellus alone had the courage to prefer exile.</p>

<p>Then, it seems, the senate found it necessary to beguile the great
general over to the side of aristocracy. Marius was a child in their
hands. He actually boggled at taking the oath to his own laws, and added
the remarkable proviso, “So far as they are valid.” Saturninus and
Glaucia in their turn tried violence, and Marius led the forces of the
senate against them. There was a battle in the forum, the demagogues
were slain, and four magistrates of the Roman people put to death
without trial. Once more reaction had triumphed. For the time being
Marius was politically defunct.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_96" id="page_96">{96}</a></span></p>

<p>But one side of his work was lasting and fraught with momentous
consequences for the Roman state. It was Marius, the first professional
general, who formed the first professional army. We noticed that Greece,
even before the end of the fifth century, had already begun to use paid
and trained soldiers, partly owing to the unwillingness of her
comfortable or busy citizens to engage in annual campaigns, but still
more because it was found that the more highly trained and better
disciplined mercenaries were far more efficient at their business. So
for many centuries Rome had now been the only power in the Mediterranean
world to rely upon a citizen militia. That citizen militia had indeed
conquered the world; but certainly in dealing with the trained troops of
Pyrrhus and Hannibal, the Roman forces had always begun with disaster
and slowly been schooled to their trade by defeat. So it was now in the
Jugurthan and Cimbric wars: the generals had to train their armies in
the face of the enemy, and while that is no doubt the best training
ground it is terribly dangerous and expensive. It implies, too, an
almost inexhaustible stock of recruits to fall back upon. With the
decline of Italian agriculture and the growth of city life the stock of
recruits was no longer inexhaustible. Moreover the art of war was
becoming more intricate. Rome found it necessary to appoint a genuine
soldier for her general against Jugurtha in view of the disastrous
failures of aristocratic amateurs. In the same way Marius found it
necessary to overhaul the Roman fighting machine, and by the end of his
five years of successive consulship he had organised a professional army
on much the same system as our own. Rome like England required a highly
trained expeditionary force and behind it a large reserve. The principal
change instituted by Marius seemed at first a small one and required no
legislative sanction. Hitherto the army had consisted only of the
propertied classes, the infantry of those who could afford a suit of
arms, and the cavalry of the richest citizens who could maintain one of
the state horses. The minimum property for a Roman soldier<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_97" id="page_97">{97}</a></span> is said to
have been £115. The poorest had originally formed a light-armed support,
the three middle classes were the line, and the richest the cavalry. But
the three classes of the line had by now come to be drawn up not
according to property but according to length of service. This was the
traditional battle formation of the Roman infantry maniples:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr valign="middle"><td class="nind"><a name="maniples" id="maniples"></a>
Triara<br /> Principes<br /> Hastats</td><td>
<a href="images/image018_lg.jpg">
<img src="images/image018_sml.jpg" alt="[Image unavailable.]" /></a>
</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="nind">with the cavalry upon the wings. But social changes were changing the
army. As wealth increased and the gulf between rich and poor grew wider
the comfortable burgesses were no longer obedient or willing soldiers.
Bad discipline&mdash;a monstrous violation of the old Roman spirit&mdash;had begun
to appear in the ranks as early as the Macedonian wars. In the Jugurthan
wars it was deplorably rife. The equestrian class as the richest was
also the most mutinous: as early as the third century the knights had
refused to work in the trenches alongside of the legionaries. By 140
<small>B.C.</small> they had ceased to act as a military force and become merely a
grade of honour, or rather of income, in the state, though the younger
knights continued to form a corps of noble guards to the general. As for
the army as a whole, the theory down to the time of Marius was still
that of the annual spring campaign; each consul levied his own army for
a specific purpose. This levy had become more and more difficult. The
simple innovation which Marius introduced was that in the process of
holding his levy he began by asking for volunteers and enrolling those
first. There was generally a distinct promise of rewards on discharge.
Thus instead of the moneyed classes Marius filled his ranks with the
poorest and hardiest inhabitants of Rome and Italy. Of course the
obligation to serve still remained part of the condition of certain
subject<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_98" id="page_98">{98}</a></span> peoples. The auxiliary ranks were now supplied by foreign
experts&mdash;cavalry from the Numidian deserts or the Ligurian hills,
slingers from the Balearic Islands, and presently archers from Crete.
Having thus professionalised his army Marius proceeded to abolish all
distinctions in the ranks. All the men of the line now had a uniform
equipment supplied by the state, and instead of a bewildering variety of
insignia all the legionaries now fought under that emblem destined to be
carried in victory to the four corners of Europe&mdash;the silver eagle. The
eagle was the standard of the legion and it was regarded as sacred. In
camp it rested in a special shrine and terrible was the disgrace
attaching to its loss in battle. Hitherto legions had been gathered for
each campaign and disbanded at its close. Now a legion had a permanent
existence, a fixed number, a tradition and an <i>esprit de corps</i> of its
own. It was now a larger unit of 6000 men; for while the maniple or
company of 120 men still remained, the maniples were grouped into
cohorts or battalions, which now became the regular tactical unit, and
ten cohorts formed the legion.</p>

<p>Beside the body-armour consisting of helmet, cuirass, and cylindrical
shield,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> the uniform equipment of the legionary included the pilum, a
short heavy javelin for throwing (it is interesting to notice that
whereas Marius had the point loosely attached to the shaft so as to
break off in the shield or body of the enemy, Julius Cæsar actually
invented what may fairly be called a “Dum-Dum pilum” with a soft nose
for stopping the rush of barbarians), and the short broad-bladed
sword<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> which had been copied from the Spanish swordsmen in the Second
Punic War. The latter was a very handy little weapon only about thirty
inches long including the hilt, with two edges as well as a point,
though the thrust was always advocated in preference to the cut. Marius
now introduced a new drill which included lessons in fencing given in
the first instance by masters from the gladiatorial schools.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_99" id="page_99">{99}</a></span> Though
bloodshed be abhorrent to the learned, many a scholar would like to have
witnessed the combat between the Roman <i>gladius</i> and the Cimbrian
claymore. It must be repeated that the Roman maniple, unlike the close
Greek phalanx, stood in open order with a six-foot square of space for
each man so that there was room for individual prowess in swordsmanship.
Lastly, Marius still further professionalised his army by introducing a
system of bounties on discharge which made the army a really attractive
career for poor citizens. He promised them each a farm at the end of the
war and his example was followed by other generals. In fact a veteran
soldier came to expect a handsome pension on retirement.</p>

</div>

<p>It is surely unnecessary to emphasise the meaning of all this. An army
was now a trained corps against which no levy of recruits could stand
for an instant. Hitherto it had been the chief guarantee against
usurpation by a general that new armies could be summoned from the soil
at any time. Now there was a weapon in the hands of a successful general
against which the feeble safeguards of the republican constitution were
powerless. As with the first trained army in English history, the
general of such a force became master of the destinies of the state so
long as the allegiance of the soldiers was personal rather than
patriotic. The Roman soldier’s allegiance had always been personal and
now it became more so. Moreover the Roman constitution had never sought
to distinguish military from civil power. Hence that day in 100 <small>B.C.</small>,
when the Appuleian code was carried under threat of the legions of
Marius, was of evil omen for the constitution. Less than twenty years
were to elapse before a Roman army entered Rome in triumph to support
the political enactments of Sulla. It is in reality henceforward one
long state of civil war, open or concealed, between rival generals,
until at last a permanent military monarchy was established. It only
required a bold free spirit like that of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_100" id="page_100">{100}</a></span>Julius Cæsar to discern the
real facts of the case. Marius, as we have already seen, had not
sufficient intellect to play a political part with success; Sulla
attained what was really a monarchical position but retired when he had
won it. Pompeius never had the courage to face the situation. Cæsar had,
but he was sacrificed to the republican tradition. Finally the
diplomatic Augustus realised the long inevitable fact.</p>

<p>Henceforth, then, it is merely a question of who shall be Emperor of
Rome. The causes of the end of Rome’s incoherent constitutional system,
called by us a Republic, are already clear. There are the constitutional
causes&mdash;above all the inelasticity of the Roman system, which made
legitimate reform impossible, provided no machinery to express the will
of the people, and rendered it inevitable that rioting should accompany
every change. It was a constitution essentially municipal and the
tribunate was the centre of mischief. Then there are the economic
causes, now working more banefully than ever, and causing the decay of
the agricultural population, the rise of a dangerous uneducated city
proletariat, and the corruption of the governing aristocracy. There was
the political fact that the government of a vast ill-organised empire
destroyed the Republican spirit and further increased corruption, while
it denationalised the Roman temper. Lastly, there is the military cause,
namely, the professionalisation of the army, putting excessive power
into the hands of the general and replacing patriotism by <i>esprit de
corps</i>.</p>

<p>It strikes the onlooker that no one of these evils, nor even the
accumulation of them, need have been fatal to the republican system if
there had been a genuine spirit of patriotic enthusiasm determined to
overcome them. For instance, if the great men of Rome had been loyal and
patriotic there is no reason why the excessive power of the generals
should have led to high treason. And again, though the provincial system
was misbegotten it might have been corrected and reformed. But it was
the spirit that failed. Was not that just because Roman power had
outstripped Roman civilisation? For the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_101" id="page_101">{101}</a></span> upper-class Roman, faith was
dead or dying, and there were no high interests of the mind to replace
it. Fighting was their sole inherited interest and their tastes were
correspondingly brutal and bloody. The last agony of the Republic in the
period we are now considering is painful enough, but the wise will
surely regard it as the period in which a new and much more hopeful
order of things was gradually evolved.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Sulla</span></h3>

<p>On the extinction of Marius there arose Sulla. Sulla was the aristocrat
of talent, almost of genius, who tried to save the state by reaction. He
tried, vainly and foolishly enough, to bolster up the rickety structure
of senatorial ascendancy, but had not the patience or the wisdom to
attempt even that with any thoroughness. L. Cornelius Sulla was of the
class of men to which Alcibiades and Alexander belong, but an inferior
specimen of the class. Though of noble birth he had risen from poverty
and obscurity by his own talents. He was clever&mdash;and he did the most
foolish acts in history. He was handsome&mdash;and his face in later life is
described as “a mulberry speckled with meal.” He was brave and
successful in war; half lion and half fox, they said, and the fox was
the more dangerous of the two. He secured the affections of his soldiers
by giving them free licence to plunder or to murder unpopular officers.
He was a rake and a gambler, reckless of bloodshed as he was careless of
praise or blame, and he had that fatal belief in a star which has led
better men than him to follow will-o’-the-wisps. He might have stood
where Cæsar stands. He would have made a very typical bad emperor, and
whatever it was that made him decline to be one, it was not patriotism.
He was as cultured as Nero, and showed it by sacking Athens, plundering
Delphi, and looting a famous library. Like Nero, but unlike the majority
of his fellow-countrymen, he had a sense of humour.</p>

<p>After the shelving of Marius and the destruction of his democratic
associates the governing clique pursued its old<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_102" id="page_102">{102}</a></span> course of headlong
folly. For one thing the aristocrats soon fell out with the capitalists,
which is always an unwise thing for aristocrats to do. The equestrian
jury-courts established by Gracchus acted with brutal simplicity on
behalf of their tax-gathering and tax-farming brothers against whatever
honest governors proceeded from the senate. Men were condemned for
honest administration in those days. For another thing the bitter cry of
the Italian “allies,” who bore all the hard knocks of the Roman service,
and in return got nothing but servitude, was persistently and
contemptuously ignored. In 95 a consular law flatly prohibited them from
ever claiming the franchise. But presently there came forward a new
reformer in M. Livius Drusus. This remarkable man might be described as
a third Gracchus, only that he saw the futility of the so-called
democracy of Rome, and adopted other means to attain his ends. On the
one hand he was a champion of the senate against the knights, and on the
other hand he was resolved to give the Italians their rights. He seems
to have promoted a widespread secret organisation among the Italians. He
then proposed four measures: the inevitable vote-catching corn law and
agrarian law, the jury-courts to be restored to the senate, the senate
for that purpose to be enlarged by the inclusion of three hundred
knights, and, lastly, citizenship for the allies. The first three were
carried, not without violence, but the fourth was his stumbling-block.
The Italians were by now so clamorous that civil war was inevitable if
it were refused, and no man denied the justice of their claim. But
neither justice nor expediency had any power to move the dead weight of
senatorial conservatism. Drusus was murdered and his laws repealed. That
was the signal for the long and terrible Social War which completed the
ruin of Italy and caused grave alarm for the very existence of Rome
herself. In the course of this struggle and in fear for her existence
Rome yielded in fact, if not openly, to the demand of the Italians. Some
states received the franchise as a reward for fidelity and others as a
bait for submission. By a law of 89 all Italians who applied<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_103" id="page_103">{103}</a></span> to the
prætor within sixty days received the citizenship, and this belated
concession had its effect. The face of Italy had been covered with
mourning to secure it. Even so the governing clique succeeded in
nullifying the political value of the concession by confining the
Italians along with the Roman freedmen to a few of the tribes so that
their votes were almost useless.</p>

<p>The pressure of this war and of the great Mithradatic war which began
simultaneously in Asia led to a serious economic crisis at Rome. Debt
and usury were the symptoms, and when a prætor tried to meet it by
reviving the old laws against usury he was murdered in his priestly
robes at sacrifice. Now we begin to hear the ominous cry of “Novæ
tabulæ”&mdash;the clean slate for debtors. A popular orator named Sulpicius
Rufus, whose programme included the exclusion of all bankrupts from the
senate, protected his valuable person with a bodyguard of 3000 hired
roughs, and organised a mock senate of 300 high-spirited young bloods.
Then, since Sulla with his army threatened opposition, he passed a
decree giving the command of the great army destined to fight
Mithradates to the old Marius. During the Social War both these generals
had held command with some success, but on the whole the reputation of
Marius had declined while that of Sulla had increased. Without
hesitation Sulla now marched his army into Rome, and won a battle in the
streets of the city. Sulpicius was of course executed, his head was
nailed to the rostra, and Marius escaped under circumstances of romantic
adventure. Sulla was thus in the year 88 completely master of Rome.</p>

<p>At this moment his real ambition was for more fighting. Mithradates,
King of Pontus,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> was then in full career of rebellion against the
Roman dominion in Asia, where 80,000 Roman traders and money-lenders
were murdered in a sudden mutiny. Sulla saw in Mithradates a worthy
foeman, and much preferred glory on the fields of Asia to Roman
politics; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_104" id="page_104">{104}</a></span> besides, his army was clamouring for plunder. So he
hastily flung out a series of constitutional reforms designed to restore
the senate to more than its ancient predominance, and then set out for
the East, heedless or ignorant of the fact that he had not really
changed anything. On the contrary he had left at Rome in sole charge the
new consul, Cinna, the worst and most dangerous of all the demagogues.
Sulla&mdash;most innocent of reprobates&mdash;seems to have fancied that an oath
to obey his constitution would restrain such a man at such a time.</p>

<p>Consequently as soon as his back was turned a fresh revolution broke
out. Cinna also brought an army to Rome and invited Marius to return.
Then the old general, furious with all his disappointments, began a
fearful debauch of bloodshed. Every distinguished senator left in Rome,
including statesmen like L. Cæsar, soldiers like Catulus, orators like
Antonius and Crassus, were butchered by his slaves and their heads
displayed in the forum. In 86 Marius gained the goal of his ambition,
that seventh consulship which had been promised him long ago by a
prophet. In the same year he died. Now for four years Cinna ruled as
monarch at Rome. Year after year he assumed the consulship and nominated
the other magistrates at his own choice without the formality of
election. He repealed the laws of Sulla, equalised all the citizens in
the tribes, and reduced all debts by 75 per cent. It is the last measure
which is truly typical of Roman democracy. Meanwhile, of course, the
reckoning was in preparation across the seas. Sulla was winning glorious
victories in Greece and Asia, and at length in 84, drove Mithradates to
surrender temporarily. Cinna, who does not seem to have
understood that a Roman army belonged not to the republic but to its
general, audaciously set out to supersede Sulla, and was murdered by the
troops.</p>

</div>

<p>Sulla, having offered terms which the government very foolishly
declined, came home in 83 after five years’ absence bearing not peace
but a sword. He had five veteran legions of his own, the exiled
aristocrats joined him, and among them<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_105" id="page_105">{105}</a></span> a young man called Pompeius with
three more legions. The lead of the democratic party had now fallen into
the hands of a young Marius, and he having no troops to oppose the
returning veterans decided to join the Samnite rebels who remained
unconquered from the Social War. Before leaving the city they ordered a
final and still more bloody massacre of the surviving aristocrats;
practically all the men of distinction left in the city suffered death.
Sulla had to fight 40,000 Samnites at the Colline Gate of Rome, and
after a desperate struggle was victorious. The young Marius committed
suicide. Thus Sulla was once more master of Rome. His 8000 Samnite
prisoners were slaughtered in the Circus. Of the Roman democrats, 80
senators, 3600 equites, and over 2000 private citizens were proscribed,
and their heads nailed up in the forum. In Spain, Sertorius, an honest
and valorous democrat, maintained a gallant struggle by the aid of a
miraculous deer, and a native Spanish army trained on the Roman model,
until at last he fell by treachery.</p>

<p>For two years Sulla was monarch at Rome. For the purpose he invented a
sort of revival of the obsolete dictatorship, without limit of time and
without a colleague. If we care for the term, Sulla was at that time as
much “Emperor” as Augustus. He enacted a whole constitution of his
own&mdash;which it is scarcely necessary to recount since scarcely anything
of it survived&mdash;all destined to put the senate on its throne again, and
then simply abdicated and retired into private life. I think he was
bored with Rome and politics. It is generally admitted that he had a
sense of humour. It was a very foolish thing to do. But Sulla’s star was
with him and he died in his bed. His dying moments were comforted by the
apparition of his deceased wife (he had had five) and son, who invited
him to join them in the land of peace and bliss beyond the grave.</p>

<p>Sulla was hardly dead before another consul had marched against Rome
with his army and suffered defeat in the city. But these were mere
episodes. The streets of the sacred city<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_106" id="page_106">{106}</a></span> were in a perpetual state of
war: every serious politician had to organise his gang of roughs, and
when the very senate-house was burnt down in one such encounter it only
seemed an excessive display of political zeal. Of constitutional
government there was little pretence. The seas were swarming with
pirates, no longer isolated rovers who preyed upon commerce, but an
organised pirate-state with head-quarters in Cilicia, and a great fleet
consisting of all the broken men and desperate outlaws of the unhappy
Mediterranean world. They sailed the high seas in fleets under admirals
who voyaged in state like princes. For their homes they had impregnable
citadels among the creeks of the Cilician and Dalmatian coasts where
they stored their families and their plunder. They were not afraid to
march inland to sack a city or loot a rich temple. Commerce at sea was
ruined, even the food-supply of the capital was occasionally cut off. On
land and even in Italy things were not much better. All through
Republican history (but seldom afterwards) we hear of risings among the
slaves of Italy. Now, under the plantation system, the inaccessible
Apennine highlands were swarming with desperate runaways who constantly
committed minor acts of brigandage. In 73 they found a leader in
Spartacus, the gladiator who was said to be of royal descent in Thrace.
Starting as a mere handful the band swelled in the course of a few
months to 40,000. Roman armies one after another and ten in all marched
against them in vain. Two consuls were defeated, many eagles were
captured, Italy was at their mercy. Respectable towns like Thurii and
Nola were seized, their prisoners were crucified like slaves or forced
with grim irony to fight one another to the death like gladiators. Thus
the most frightful form of civil war was devastating Italy. It was
necessary to raise an army of eight legions to crush the slaves, and the
command was entrusted to Marcus Crassus, who even then had to decimate a
legion before he could get his cowardly troops to stand and fight. After
several stubborn battles, and aided by the want of discipline which was
even<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_107" id="page_107">{107}</a></span> more conspicuous among the slaves than among the Romans, Crassus
accomplished his task. Six thousand crucified slaves who lined the road
from Capua to Rome testified to the restoration of order.</p>

<p>Abroad matters were little better. The war against Mithradates, which
had provided so many Roman triumphs and had so often been proclaimed at
an end, actually lasted for twenty-five years, and its duration was due
rather to the ineptitude of the government than to the prowess of the
unmilitary Asiatics. In Spain it took ten years to defeat Sertorius with
his native troops, and even then the result was only accomplished by
assassination. If a Hannibal had entered Italy in these latter days the
state could not have survived. But there was only one military power of
any consequence left in the world in those days, the Parthians. Here
there were half-hellenised despots ruling over tribes of warriors only
lately descended from the Caucasian and Armenian highlands, and still
nursing a fierce mountain spirit though they occupied the rich plains of
Mesopotamia. Crassus, the victor over the slaves, was sent to fight them
with a great army, but the millionaire displayed wretched ignorance of
strategy and especially of the perils of Eastern warfare. He blundered
on into the wilderness and tried to meet the terrible horse-bowmen and
mail-clad lancers of the East with his legions in a hollow square. The
result was the great disaster of Carrhæ in 53, a defeat which amid all
the shameful ignominies of this period rankled continually owing to the
loss of the eagles and the tragic fate of the leader. Marcus Crassus
himself was an almost wholly repulsive character, who had amassed a
fortune, colossal even in those days of millionaires, by the most
discreditable method. The foundations of his millions had been laid by
speculating in the property of the victims of Sulla’s proscriptions. He
had been a slave-trainer on a large scale and at one time he had
organised a private fire-brigade which he used for acquiring
house-property cheaply by blackmail. By lending money to the young
spendthrifts of the aristocracy he obtained<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_108" id="page_108">{108}</a></span> great influence at Rome,
and indeed figures in the wretched politics of his day as a statesman on
equality with really great men like Cæsar and Pompeius. But he had no
policy and was only of importance through his wealth and influence.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Pompeius and Cæsar</span></h3>

<p>So we come to the final phase of the Republic&mdash;the great struggle
between the giants Cæsar and Pompeius, with figures like Cicero, Cato,
and Clodius in the background. I do not propose to linger over this
period, because on the one hand it is so thoroughly well known as the
period of fullest evidence in all Roman history, and therefore would
require a volume for adequate treatment, and on the other hand because
it has been such a battle-ground for partisan historians of all times
that it is difficult in such a summary as this to do justice without
detailed argument.</p>

<p>Gneius Pompeius the Great<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> had first come into prominence as a
supporter of Sulla. He was of high official family and was a born
soldier. That is really the secret of his career. Like Marius he was a
general and no statesman, but he was a very great general, and one of
the few honest men, one might almost say one of the few gentlemen, of
his period. The tragedy of his life was to be born in such a period. He
had disdained the minor offices of state, and relying on his military
renown but in defiance of the law, he stood for the consulship in 70
<small>B.C.</small> As the official aristocracy objected he went over to the democrats,
and allied himself with Crassus. These two, elected under threat of
Pompeius’s army, straightway repealed most of the Sullan constitution,
and restored the balance of power to the knights and the assembly. At
the end of the year Pompeius retired into private life. This was
characteristic of him; he was capable of grandiose schemes but he lived
in fear of public opinion, and he was really moved when orators spoke of
illegality. Meanwhile there was a loud demand for some comprehensive
scheme of attack upon the pirates. No ordinary</p>

</div>

<p class="nind"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_109" id="page_109">{109}</a></span> consular command would
do. Even the Roman senate was by this time convinced that it was useless
to send legions and cavalry against pirate ships. Accordingly a Gabinian
Law of 67 gave to Pompeius a command of unprecedented magnitude.
Millions of money were voted to him, he was to be supreme over all the
seas and all the coasts for fifty miles inland for three years, with a
staff of twenty-five legates, and all governors were to obey his orders.
The price of corn fell at once: Pompeius discovered abundance of it in
the granaries of the Sicilian corn trust. Then he began a systematic
drive of the seas, and in about three months had cleared them. Thousands
of pirates were caught and crucified. All this made Pompeius the most
powerful and the most dangerous man in Rome.</p>

<p>Next the tribune Manilius, in whose favour that rising <i>novus homo</i> the
friend of our youth, Marcus Tullius Cicero, pronounced an oration, gave
to Pompeius another huge commission against Mithradates, the
irrepressible rebel of Asia. Pompeius succeeded where all his
predecessors, from Sulla to Lucullus, had failed, and the wicked old
king was driven to suicide. Then Pompeius proceeded to organise the East
like an Alexander, but always in perfect loyalty to Rome.</p>

<p>While Pompeius was absent the so-called democracy, which mostly
consisted of hired ruffians in the pay of discontented nobles, ruled the
streets of the city. Among the young nobles who took this side was one
more dissolute and more foppish than the rest, a notorious adulterer and
spendthrift, Gaius Julius Cæsar. Though of the highest birth&mdash;the
goddess Venus by her marriage with the father of Æneas was among his
ancestors&mdash;he was also by lineage associated with the democracy. His
aunt was the wife of Marius, and his wife was a daughter of Cinna. He
began his public career quaintly enough as <i>pontifex maximus</i>. When
Julia the widow of Marius died, young Cæsar had the audacity to display
images and utter an oration in praise of Marius. This, as was intended,
set all the gossips talking, and his amazing extravagance kept him well
in the public eye. On one occasion he exhibited three<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_110" id="page_110">{110}</a></span> hundred
gladiators in silver armour, although he was known to be penniless.
Probably Crassus was his financier all along.</p>

<p>At this time there was another of the frequently recurring financial
crises at Rome. Everybody was deeply in debt, and loud rose the cry for
the clean slate, as part of the democratic programme&mdash;the only
intelligible part. This was the cause of the famous conspiracy of
Catiline, who, if Cicero may be trusted, proposed to seize and burn Rome
by the aid of the discontented Sullan colonists in Etruria. Both Cæsar
and Crassus are said to have favoured the plot, but it is exceedingly
difficult to see what a large owner of Roman house property had to gain
by it. Cicero was the consul for the year 63, and though it is the
fashion just now to sneer at Cicero, he seems to have displayed courage
and promptitude in dealing with the conspirators. Unfortunately his
arrest and execution of Catiline was technically illegal. Cicero
himself, as a parvenu, was naturally an aristocrat, and his policy,
though futile, was intelligible. Briefly, it was to unite the senate
with the capitalist class in what he called the “union of the orders”
against the democratic elements of disorder. Pompeius came home from the
East to find the conspiracy crushed. He and his legions were not wanted.
With incredible folly and ingratitude the senate, led by Cicero, refused
even to grant the lands he had promised to his veterans.</p>

<p>Cæsar had gone as prætor to Spain, and there began to win military
renown&mdash;much to the surprise of his friends&mdash;and money. He wanted the
consulship for the next year, and therefore required the support of
Pompeius, who had now been driven away from the aristocratic party to
which he belonged by sympathy. Crassus came in as Cæsar’s creditor and
as the necessary millionaire. Thus was formed the Triumvirate of the
year 60, and in 59 Cæsar became consul. By this time he had conceived
high, possibly the highest, ambitions. Marius and Sulla, not to mention
Alexander and Æneas, had always been much in his mind. For the present
his object was to acquire a lasting office and secure the allegiance of
a trained army.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_111" id="page_111">{111}</a></span> Cæsar’s colleague in the consulship was a certain
Bibulus, who tried to stop the dangerous proceedings of the democrat by
seeing omens in the heavens every day, but no one, least of all Cæsar,
took any notice of him. The only serious opposition came from Cato the
Younger, who represented the genuine and respectable aristocracy. This
Cato was a queer anachronism at Rome, an honest man. He was also, if
biography may be trusted, a bigot and a priggish eccentric. He was the
sort of man to go about Africa without a hat, or to sit on the judicial
bench without shoes, because such was the <i>mos maiorum</i>. He tried to
revive the ways which had been styled old-fashioned in his grandfather.
Nevertheless he was upright and brave, a good soldier, and a man with a
clear though impossible policy. Once again it is the fault of rhetorical
history that all the good men of Rome appear as prigs and eccentrics.
This man most courageously opposed his veto to the proceedings of Cæsar,
though he was hustled and beaten by the democratic hirelings, then
organised under that most notorious scoundrel Clodius. But the result
was that though Cæsar’s laws might pass, they could afterwards be
declared illegal, and Cæsar would be liable to prosecution as soon as he
became a private citizen. However, he had no immediate intention of
becoming a private citizen. He secured the province of Gaul for five
years with four legions.</p>

<p>Now Gaul was not reckoned an important province. It was only the
peaceful plain of Upper Italy to which the senate had added Narbonensian
Gaul, a southern strip of France, chiefly considered as a step on the
road to Spain. Four legions was a small consular army for those days; no
one supposed that he would have much fighting. But either Cæsar had
received secret intelligence or else he had very good luck. At the
outset he was called to deal with a great immigration of the barbarian
Helvetii, who were migrating out of Switzerland into Gaul and
threatening the province.</p>

<p>The conservatives at Rome maintained that Cæsar’s conquests in Gaul were
the result of wanton aggression&mdash;cheap<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_112" id="page_112">{112}</a></span> victories over inoffensive
savages, wholly unjustifiable and unauthorised. At this point it is
scarcely possible to avoid entering upon the much-debated question of
Cæsar’s real character. For orthodox Romans Cæsar was the founder of the
empire, a person not only of divine descent, but himself divine. All
emperors took his name, until that surname of Cæsar, once a mere
nickname, came, in half the languages of Europe, to be synonymous with
“Emperor.” For the Middle Ages he stood with Constantine, who
christianised the Empire, and Charlemagne, who revived it, as the
founder of that divinely instituted polity which shared with the Church
God’s viceregency on earth. In the eyes of Dante, Cæsar stood very near
to Christ, for the poet peoples the frozen heart of his Inferno with
three tormented figures who writhe in the very jaws of Cocytus. Along
with Judas Iscariot are the two murderers of Julius Cæsar. Though the
Renaissance stripped him of much of his legendary greatness, Cæsar
remained for the men of Shakespeare’s day the embodiment of imperial
pride. Shakespeare himself was too great an artist to make any of his
characters more or less than human, but it is evidently Brutus who has
the sympathies of the dramatist. In the French Revolution, again, Brutus
and Cassius were heroes and glorious tyrannicides. The reaction against
early nineteenth-century liberalism brought Cæsar once more into honour,
and Mommsen, the prophet of Cæsarism, makes him the hero of his great
history. To Mommsen Cæsar was almost divine, the clear-sighted and
magnanimous “saviour” who alone saw the true path out of the disorders
of his city. From this view again we are apparently now in reaction once
more. To the latest critics the greatness of Cæsar and of Mommsen are
alike abhorrent, and Signor Ferrero depicts his greatest
fellow-countryman as an unscrupulous demagogue who blundered into renown
through treachery and bloodshed.</p>

TEMPLE OF FORTUNA VIRILIS, ROME</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The historical principle by which this result is attained is rather
typical of certain modern critical methods. Since the account of the
Gallic Wars was written chiefly by Cæsar<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_113" id="page_113">{113}</a></span> himself, and Cæsar is by
hypothesis a scoundrel, the history of these wars must be found by
reading between the lines of Cæsar’s account, putting the most
unfavourable construction upon everything and preferring any evidence to
his, even if it be that of two centuries later. If any gaps or
inconsistencies are noticed they must be treated as concealing defeats
or acts of treachery. Written in this spirit, the story of the Gallic
Wars is a very black one for Cæsar and Rome. Yet unbiassed readers must
generally admit that Cæsar was a very careful and on the whole an honest
historian. The accusation that he was capable of relentless cruelty
springs from his own admissions. It was in the Roman character to
despise life, and when Cæsar thought that a rebellious tribe needed a
lesson he did not hesitate to massacre defenceless women and children or
to lay waste miles of territory with fire and sword. But, on the other
hand, his preference was for clemency and justice.</p>

<p>Without making him a demigod, we ought to be able to see his greatness.
As a young man his ardour of soul, working in a debased society without
ideals, made him simply more extravagant and more foppish than the
spendthrifts and rakes who surrounded him. Doubtless the scandalous
Suetonius has embellished the story of his early follies. Many of his
youthful escapades were, one suspects, carefully designed to bring him
into notice. It is probable that from a very early age he was ambitious,
and his family connections clearly marked out his career as a democrat.
He had the failure of Sulla before his eyes. The greatness of his
character lay chiefly in an instinctive hatred for muddle and pretence.
He could not fail to see the hopeless confusion into which the Roman
state had fallen. From the first, I think, he was aiming at power for
himself in order to put things straight. Whether self or country came
first in his calculations, it is hard, perhaps impossible, to decide;
but the historian is not necessarily a cynic when he demands strong
proof of altruism in the world of politics. To obtain power the
democratic side<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_114" id="page_114">{114}</a></span> was the only possible one, for the nobles stood for the
predominance only of their class. Crassus was necessary to Cæsar as his
banker and creditor until he had acquired a fortune for himself by
conquest. Pompeius was the foremost soldier of the day, and it is
probable that Cæsar deliberately sought to climb over the shoulders of
Pompeius into monarchy. He saw&mdash;he could not help seeing, for it was
written plainly in the history of the past century&mdash;that for power two
things were necessary, the support of the mob in the forum and the
backing of a veteran army. At the time when Cæsar got Gaul for his
province there was a fresh movement towards imperial expansion. Foreign
conquest afforded some relief for the chagrins of internal politics. By
it Marius, Sulla, and Pompeius had become powerful. If Cæsar wanted to
eclipse them all, he must present Rome with a new province, the most
powerful of all bribes. It was in this spirit that he set out for Gaul.
If his ulterior motive was selfish it is certain that he threw himself
heart and soul, with all the burning energy of which his tireless spirit
was capable, into the work of conquest and civilisation.</p>

<p>And what a work it was! Archæology is now beginning to prove to history
that the so-called barbarians were by no means always savages. Even the
“naked woad-stained” Britons had their arts and industries and political
systems. The Gauls, when Cæsar attacked them, were well on the road to
civilisation. Druidism was a declining force, town-life was beginning,
and there was even a fairly artistic coinage. The Gallic pottery is by
no means destitute of beauty. As soldiers the Gauls showed many of the
qualities of their descendants, a devoted impetuosity in the charge,
coupled with a lack of tenacity in resistance which always cost them
dear. Much of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_115" id="page_115">{115}</a></span> Cæsar’s success was due to his skill in dividing them
against themselves, but many of his difficulties arose from their fickle
disposition. Mommsen, like a true Bismarckian German, has a striking
comparison of the ancient Gallic Celt with the modern Irishman.</p>

<p>“On the eve,” he says, “of parting from this remarkable nation, we may
be allowed to call attention to the fact that in the accounts of the
ancients as to the Celts on the Loire and the Seine we find almost every
one of the characteristic traits which we are accustomed to recognise as
marking the Irish. Every feature reappears: the laziness in the culture
of the fields; the delight in tippling and brawling; the ostentation ...
the droll humour ... the hearty delight in singing and reciting the
deeds of past ages, and the most decided talent for rhetoric and poetry;
the curiosity&mdash;no trader was allowed to pass before he had told in the
open street what he knew, or did not know, in the shape of news&mdash;and the
extravagant credulity which acted on such accounts ... the childlike
piety which sees in the priest a father and asks him for advice in all
things” (this, by the way, was apparently a characteristic of the
contemporary Germans also), “the unsurpassed fervour of national
feeling, and the closeness with which those who are fellow-countrymen
cling together almost like one family in opposition to the stranger; the
inclination to rise in revolt under the first chance leader that
presents himself, but at the same time the utter incapacity to preserve
a self-reliant courage equally remote from presumption and
pusillanimity, to perceive the right time for waiting and for striking,
to obtain or even barely to tolerate any organisation, any sort of fixed
military or political discipline. It is, and remains, at all times and
places the same indolent and poetical, irresolute and fervid,
inquisitive, credulous, amiable, clever, but&mdash;from a political point of
view&mdash;thoroughly useless nation; and therefore its fate has been always
and everywhere the same.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_116" id="page_116">{116}</a></span>”</p>

<p>The internal politics of Gaul seem to have been marked by a division
between two parties, one the conservative party of the aristocratic
knights, the other a nationalist and popular faction. Cæsar used these
divisions for the furtherance of his scheme of conquest. He was not only
a consummate general with an instinct for strategic points and huge
combinations, but he was also a superb regimental officer in the making
of soldiers. By the end of his ten years he had forged a small but
invincible army devoted to his interests and entirely confident in his
leadership. Personally, moreover, the Roman debauchee was the best
soldier in the army. Physically he was a stranger to weariness or
fatigue. He could travel immense distances with incredible rapidity,
alone on horseback, or with a handful of followers. He seemed
ubiquitous. In the battle, when his men wavered, he would leap down into
the ranks, sword in hand, or snatch the standard from the hand of a
centurion and fight among the foremost. No detail of fortification or
commissariat escaped him, and he, more than any one else, showed the
power of engineering in warfare. In the supreme battle against Pompeius
he even carried his devotion to the spade beyond reasonable limits when
he tried to circumvallate the much larger camp of his enemies. One of
his most surprising exploits was when half Gaul, supposed to be
pacified, rose in sudden revolt under Vercingetorix. With a much smaller
army he chased the rebels into the fortress of Alesia, neglecting for
the time all communication with his base, and fully aware that a still
larger army would soon advance to the relief of the besieged. He
therefore entrenched himself outside the gates of the city and kept off
the relieving force with one hand while he continued the siege with the
other. But while he was capable of brilliant strokes of audacity like
this, he was also a cold and cautious organiser of victory, ready to
meet his enemies on their own ground and with their own weapons.</p>

</div>

<p>In this great war, which ended in the conquest of Gaul,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_117" id="page_117">{117}</a></span> Cæsar’s
expeditions to Britain were mere episodes which have been greatly
exaggerated in the traditional histories of our schools. They were
summer raids, like his dash across the Rhine, intended for a warning to
the barbarians of the hinterland; for it seems that communication to and
fro across the channel was continuous. It is probable enough that the
persuasions of the Roman traders who swarmed after the eagles across
Gaul had their influence also. Undoubtedly the Romans of this generation
were keenly alive to commercial openings, and always on the search for
mines, real or imaginary. Further, we cannot deny that Cæsar in all his
undertakings had one eye upon his political position in Rome itself, and
the “conquest of Britain,” that almost legendary corner of the earth,
concealed in boreal mists and embosomed in the ever-flowing Ocean river,
would be a sensational achievement calculated to outshine the Oriental
triumphs of Pompeius. One cannot but place among the extravagances of
hero-worship Mommsen’s belief that Cæsar had a prophetic insight into
the true nature of the “German Peril” for Rome. When Cæsar took over the
Gallic province there was no tremendous German menace. There had always
been occasional irruptions of the barbarians from across the Rhine, and
a steady German penetration of the Netherlands. Cæsar did not lay down
any intelligible frontier policy: that was one of the achievements of
Augustus. Both in Gaul and Britain it was simply a forward movement by a
general of bold and untiring resolution, backed by an invincible army.
The two trips to Britain, like those across the Rhine, were
reconnaissances only, and the conquest of the island was one of the
legacies which Cæsar intended to reserve for the future. His successor
very wisely declined it. There was little immediate profit there, and
the Gallic conquests had glutted the Roman market with slaves.</p>

<p>Gaul had submitted easily to a force of less than forty thousand Romans;
then it had revolted unsuccessfully. In the end the whole country
acknowledged defeat and rapidly <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_118" id="page_118">{118}</a></span>began to assimilate Latin civilisation.
Meanwhile in the imperial city the Republic was slowly expiring by a
natural death. Every winter Cæsar returned to the Cisalpine part of his
province to receive intelligence from Rome and secure his position
there. Clodius, the most evil of mob-leaders, was his agent with the
democracy. Clodius had managed to hound the respectable Cicero into
exile for his share in suppressing Catiline, and when Cicero, who was
really popular at Rome, had at length persuaded Pompeius to allow his
return, the great orator remained thenceforward a timid and reluctant
servant of the triumvirate, defending their friends or prosecuting their
enemies, with inward reluctance, no doubt, but with unimpaired
eloquence. With his astonishing victories in Gaul the star of Julius was
rising in the political heavens. The commons of Rome were not only
dazzled by his successes, but captivated by his largesses. Meanwhile
Pompeius was living on his military reputation, and slowly squandering
it by his political incapacity. He continued to hold various high
offices unknown to the constitution; he became sole consul, a thing
abhorrent to the Roman system; he held the province of Spain and
governed it from Italy through his legates, and at the same time
continued to exercise a general oversight over the corn-supply of Rome.
In fact there was scarcely anything in the future position of a Roman
emperor which had not its precedent in the career of Pompeius. Had he
wished it, or, more probably, had he known how to obtain it, he and not
Augustus might easily have been the first Roman emperor. By taste and
natural sympathies he was an aristocrat, but the force of circumstances
had driven him into an uncomfortable position of alliance with Cæsar the
democrat and Crassus the plutocrat. This was in a large measure the
secret of his political helplessness. He, the conqueror of the East,
often found himself openly flouted, nay, actually hustled and threatened
in the streets, by the organised roughs. Meanwhile there was a small but
tenacious opposition party of aristocrats, who had no discipline and
therefore no leaders, but among whom Cato and Marcellus were the most
conspicuous. They had not the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_119" id="page_119">{119}</a></span> strength to offer any consistent
resistance to Cæsar’s progress, which they watched with growing jealousy
and alarm. They had not the sense to rally the respectable elements in
the state to their side. Both Cicero and Pompeius would readily have
joined them if they had made it possible. Instead of that, they were
content to carp at Cæsar’s achievements and threaten him with a
prosecution as soon as he should return to private life. That was the
stupidest mistake, for it made Cæsar resolve at all costs to retain his
command, and eventually precipitated the civil war.</p>

<p>As it can easily be seen, the coalition between Cæsar and Pompeius was
not a natural one: psychologically they had nothing in common, and their
interests soon began to diverge. Pompeius could hardly fail to perceive
that Cæsar was climbing by his help and at his expense. The old general
saw the memory of his great deeds eclipsed by the new one, and there was
no lack of mischief-makers to widen the breach. The alliance had been
cemented in a striking fashion at a conference at Lucca in 56 <small>B.C.</small> when
the conservatives were threatening to annul Cæsar’s acts in Gaul. Cæsar
had replied by inviting Pompeius to meet him in his southern province;
he also invited those senators who were his friends to appear at the
same time. Two hundred senators had answered the invitation, and for the
time being the opposition died away into grumbling.</p>

<p>But now the breach was growing open to all men’s eyes. Cæsar’s charming
daughter, Julia, who had been married to Pompeius as a pledge of union,
and had done much to hold the two chiefs together, died at an early age
in the year 54. In the next year Crassus, the mediating third party of
the “triumvirate,” met his fate at Carrhæ. In the next there were more
than ordinary disorders over the elections, culminating in a fierce
battle in the forum between the rival gangs of Clodius for the
triumvirate and Milo for the senate. The senate-house was burnt and
Clodius slain. Pompeius then became sole consul, and proceeded, under
threat of his army,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_120" id="page_120">{120}</a></span> to introduce a series of laws almost openly aimed
at Cæsar. By the Pompeian law of magistrates Cæsar would be compelled to
appear in Rome as a private citizen for some months in the year 49, at
the mercy of his enemies, while Pompeius himself, by having his titular
command in Spain prolonged, would still be master of an army. These laws
were passed at the crisis of Cæsar’s fate in Gaul, when the whole nation
had risen in arms against him. But Cæsar emerged victorious, and was
now, in the year 50, free to consider his position in regard to Pompeius
and the senate. Cæsar himself maintains that he was reluctant to resort
to violence, and I think we may believe him. Though nine legions were
still under his command, he could hardly venture to denude the newly
conquered province of its garrisons, while Pompeius was master of an
equal number of legions, including the veteran Spanish troops, and could
levy any number of recruits or reservists in Italy. Cæsar could not have
faced the prospect of a civil war with any confidence as to the result,
even if he had been the sort of man to provoke it without scruple. There
is a further proof: as late as 50 <small>B.C.</small> he resigned two legions to
Pompeius, which would have been madness if he had then intended to wade
through bloodshed to a throne. In all the abortive negotiations which
preceded the outbreak of the great civil war, Cæsar was prepared to
resign everything except the one condition upon which his very life
depended, namely, that he should not have to return to Rome as a
defenceless private citizen. The civil war was due to the mad folly of
the conservatives led by Marcellus, who had convinced themselves that
Cæsar meant to sack Rome with his Gallic cavalry and to reign as tyrant
over its ashes. In the end they succeeded in communicating their panic
to Pompeius.</p>

<p>Conciliatory to the last, Cæsar was driven to show that he was in
earnest. Bidden to dismiss his army, and declared a public enemy, in
January 49 <small>B.C.</small> he took the decisive step of crossing the little river
Rubicon which marked the frontier of Italy. Even then it was only a
demonstration of force. Only 1500 men followed Cæsar to Rimini and
Arezzo, and he still<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_121" id="page_121">{121}</a></span> offered peace on the most moderate terms. But the
panic-stricken and conscience-stricken senators, still believing in the
imminent sack of Rome, decided to leave their wives and children there
while they saved their precious necks, in headlong flight to Capua, and
then to Brindisi, and then to Greece. The great Pompeius showed equal
panic. Apparently demoralised by Cæsar’s swift and decisive movements,
he decided to give up Italy without a struggle and retire to the East,
where all his triumphs had been won. From there he would fight for the
lordship of the world.</p>

<p>But meanwhile Cæsar, by his clemency no less than by his bold
resolution, was winning all Italy to his side. Only one member of his
army&mdash;his old lieutenant-general Labienus&mdash;deserted him, while fresh
recruits even from the senatorial party daily joined him. Cool and
methodical as ever, he left Rome to recover from its panic, and the East
to wait until he had secured his hold upon the West. He knew the value
of a veteran army, and therefore turned his march first to Spain. It
took him but a short time to secure the capitulation of Pompeius’s
lieutenants in that province, and then at last he returned to Rome. He
was only in the city for eleven days, but in that time he was able to
remove the panic and disorder there. He restored credit, assured the
supply of corn, and got a grant of citizen rights for his faithful
provincials of Cisalpine Gaul.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Pompeian army was gathering in northern Greece, and the
senators were breathing death and damnation against Cæsar. The final
struggle on the Albanian coast and in Thessaly, which culminated in the
great battle of Pharsalus (48 <small>B.C.</small>), decided the fate of the world. The
troops were fairly equal, if numbers and training are taken into
account; in numbers alone Cæsar was far inferior. But Cæsar’s men had
extraordinary devotion to their general, as he had to his beloved
legions. Never was there completer confidence between an army and its
leader than between Cæsar and his veterans. He <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_122" id="page_122">{122}</a></span>could be merciless in
discipline. Once he had to decimate the Ninth Legion, but he could move
his grim legionaries to tears by a reproach. He shared all their
labours, he starved with them, and marched those prodigious forced
marches by their side. They trusted in his generalship, and they were
not disappointed. Pompeius showed, when at last he roused himself, that
he too had not forgotten the military art. It was a battle of giants;
Pompeius the more orthodox tactician, Cæsar incredibly bold, rapid, and
far-seeing. More than once it was touch and go. Cæsar had terrible
difficulties to face, above all in the necessity of transporting his
army across the wintry Adriatic in face of the enemy when he had no
fleet. The feat was accomplished by sheer audacity, and then he had to
face and contain a larger army, thoroughly well prepared and supplied,
with no base and no communications for his own men. He actually tried to
fling a line of earthworks round the Pompeian army while his own men
were starving. Yet it was by generalship that the battle of Pharsalus
was won.</p>

<p>Pompeius fled to Egypt for refuge, and was murdered there by treacherous
Alexandrians and renegade Romans. Cæsar, who had received the submission
of the whole provincial world with the exception of King Juba’s African
realm, followed Pompeius to Egypt, and on landing was presented with his
rival’s head. In Alexandria itself Cæsar had to face one of the most
serious crises of his life. For six months he held the royal palace
against a host of infuriated Orientals. In the palace was Cleopatra, the
wife and sister of the reigning Ptolemy, and then a brilliant and
fascinating young woman of twenty. Let us believe that she was
beautiful, and that the portrait-painters and coin-engravers of her day
were incompetent or disloyal.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> But if rumour spoke truly, Cæsar was
by no means exclusive in his devotion to female charms. Her son was
named Cæsarion.</p>

<p>When at length Julius Cæsar escaped from the twofold entanglements of
love and battle at Alexandria, he had more fighting still before he
could make the earth his footstool. He spent a few days in Syria to
arrange the affairs of the East, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_123" id="page_123">{123}</a></span> among other things gave orders to
build up the wall of Jerusalem, which had been thrown down by the orders
of Pompeius. Then he passed over to Asia Minor, and at Zela crushed the
rebellion of a Pontic successor of Mithradates. So back to Italy for a
few weeks, and there he found all in disorder, and his legions,
including the faithful Tenth, mutinying for their pay. He settled the
disorder at Rome by his mere presence, enacted laws to relieve the
economic distress there, and, having no money to pay his soldiers,
quelled their mutiny by sheer sleight of speech. Meanwhile the broken
Pompeians had gathered in thousands at the court of King Juba, who
himself had a formidable host. As soon as he could find time, the
restless conqueror crossed straight to Africa with as many soldiers as
he could muster, leaving the main force to follow. That was always
Cæsar’s way&mdash;to dart straight upon the scene of danger was his first
instinct. At his coming the marrow oozed out of the very bones of his
foe. He had a Scipio and a Cato, and a host of notable Romans arrayed
against him. At Thapsus, in April of the year 46, he smote them, and
slew (it is said) fifty thousand men&mdash;fourteen legions of Romans. There
at Utica, Cato died his famous Stoic death, far the noblest scene of his
mistaken life, and so became a theme for the glorification of Stoic
Republicanism for all time. Afranius, Scipio, King Juba, Faustus Sulla,
and many others, died also. A few stragglers found their way to Spain,
to continue the fight there under the two sons of Pompeius. Thither in
the next year, so soon as he had leisure, Cæsar followed them, and in a
last great battle at Munda he finished the resistance. Only Sextus
Pompeius was left of the Pompeian party, and he escaped for a time to
begin an interesting career as a gentleman-pirate.</p>

<p>In this manner the amazing Cæsar conquered the world. Now it was
unquestionably his. What was he to make of it? This story has been told
in vain unless it has shown that the city of Rome was rotten to the
core, with no sound elements left in it. Cæsar himself was a solitary
prodigy; he had no supporters worthy of his confidence. Labienus had
deserted<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_124" id="page_124">{124}</a></span> him, Quintus Cicero, another of his legates in Gaul, had also
fought against him. Mark Antony was perhaps his right-hand man, but
Antony was nothing but a brilliant orator and a fair soldier; of
character or reputation he had not a shred. Brutus, to whom Cæsar was
personally devoted, had fought against him, and was&mdash;in spite of
Shakespeare and republican tradition&mdash;a vain and shallow egoist. Cæsar
had no brother and no legitimate son. Across in Apollonia his little
great-nephew Octavius was still at school. Julius Cæsar had to
reorganise a broken world alone. For a hundred years there had been no
peace in Rome, and no proper government in the empire. Every year of its
lingering agony, the Republic had drawn closer to the inevitable issue
in Monarchy. Even Cicero, when he tried to console himself for the
horrible disorders of Roman life by depicting an ideal commonwealth, had
been compelled to build it round a <i>princeps</i> who should maintain order,
and thus allow liberty to exist. In practice also the last century had
seen a succession of “princes”&mdash;Gracchus, Marius, Cinna, Sulla,
Pompeius&mdash;all from the necessity of the case forced into
unconstitutional positions. And now Cæsar had succeeded without a rival.
Sulla had resigned power, and his work had almost immediately fallen to
pieces. There was now, even more than then, no chance of building up a
senatorial party, and indeed Cæsar had been the lifelong victim of
senatorial arrogance and folly. It was equally impossible to build up a
Roman democracy out of the demoralised loungers in the forum.</p>

<p>Obviously monarchy was the only solution. Cæsar was fifty-five years
old, spent with war and labour, and, as I have said, quite alone. He was
a man without beliefs or illusions or scruples. Not a bad man: for he
preferred justice and mercy to tyranny and cruelty, and he had a passion
for logic and order. He was not the sort of man to make compromises. His
sudden successes had taught him to despise his enemies. He was not, of
course, ignorant that the Romans (if there were any true Romans left)
had it in their blood to hate the title of Rex. Every Roman schoolboy
was brought up to declaim in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_125" id="page_125">{125}</a></span> praise of regicides. But possibly in time
they could be accustomed to the hideous idea. For the present,
old-fashioned titles like Dictator, Consul, and Tribune would suffice.
But the office must be made hereditary, and the boy Octavius was already
marked for adoption and succession. The title of Rex could wait. Cæsar
would feel his way gently.</p>

<p>But patience was not one of his virtues. Actually fortune only left him
less than two years, and those broken by tedious campaigns in the
Spanish provinces, for the regeneration of Roman society. In that time
he restored the finances, rearranged the provincial system, abolished
the political clubs which had been centres of disorder at Rome, reformed
the Calendar, dedicated a new forum and new temples, restored and
revised the senate, founded a system of municipal government for Italy,
settled his veterans on the land, and was preparing a great expedition
to chastise the Parthians.</p>

<p>Most of these acts were wisely done, but in one thing Cæsar
miscalculated. His brilliant successes and the adulation with which he
was surrounded led him to despise his enemies. He would not stoop to
flatter antiquarian prejudices or to cast a decent veil over his
monarchical position. You may treat people as slaves and they will
admire you for it, but when you <i>call</i> them slaves they will begin to
resent it. Cæsar failed to rise from his chair to receive the senators.
In his reformed senate he included representatives of the equestrian
class, provincials and even distinguished soldiers of quite humble
birth. He allowed his statue to be set up beside the Seven Kings of
Rome. He accepted a gilt chair, he permanently retained the triumphant
general’s laurel-crown, partly because he was bald and keenly sensitive
about it; and then either through his orders or by their own
officiousness his friends began to throw up <i>ballons d’essai</i> in the
direction of kingship. At the Lupercalia Antony offered him a crown of
gold. It was spread abroad that an ancient Sibylline prophecy had
foretold that the Parthians could only be conquered by a king and that
Cæsar was to adopt the title for the purpose of his Eastern expedition.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_126" id="page_126">{126}</a></span>
It was trifles like these, and trivial jealousies, trivial requests
declined in the name of justice, that led to the great conspiracy. No
doubt the influence of rhetorical patriotism had its effect upon many of
the conspirators. An unknown hand wrote “O that thou wert living!” upon
the statue of old Brutus the Liberator. But neither Brutus nor Cassius
deserves our admiration. It was pique not patriotism that sharpened
their daggers. Sixty senators conspired together, and on the eve of
setting out for Parthia&mdash;the Ides of March, 44 <small>B.C.</small>&mdash;Julius Cæsar was
slain.</p>

<p>And then, having slain the tyrant and liberated the republic, the
patriots were helpless. A doctrinaire like Cicero might still dream of
restoring the commonwealth; but the only real question was who should
succeed. The people only cried for peace. It was not so much the speech
of Mark Antony as the funeral of Cæsar, cleverly stage-managed by
Calpurnia, and the genuine sorrow of his veterans, which gradually
turned the popular feeling against the conspirators. The senate did not
venture to declare Cæsar a tyrant, they confirmed his acts, but there
was no proposal to punish the murderers. The whole conclusion was a
feeble compromise.</p>

<p>The man who should have grasped the helm was Mark Antony. He was left
sole consul, there was a legion and the prætorian cohort under arms only
waiting the word. The conspirators had only a few gladiators in their
pay. Antony had every right to arrest them. But Antony was not the man
for the part. With all his talents his character was feeble. He was
always dependent on his surroundings and generally under feminine
influence. Once it had been the dancer Cytheris, at present it was the
aggressive Fulvia; for a time Octavia almost reformed him, but Cleopatra
easily ensnared him. He was a rake and a spendthrift, always in debt. He
was timid of public opinion: just now the aristocratic society in which
he moved was prating of tyrannicide. Antony wanted to be in the fashion.
There were dramatic embracements between Antony and Brutus.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_127" id="page_127">{127}</a></span></p>

<p>Now the testament of Cæsar, which had just been confirmed by the senate,
named young Gneius Octavius as heir to three-quarters of his estate. At
the end of the will was a codicil adopting him. Henceforth until he gets
the title of Augustus this young Cæsar must be called Octavianus, though
he never accepted that name for himself. The “second heirs” named in
case the first should fail or decline to succeed included D. Brutus, one
of the murderers, and Mark Antony himself. Whosoever should accept the
heirship would be bound by all Roman ideas of honour to undertake the
chastisement of the murderers. Antony seems to have assumed that the
obscure young man would not be likely to accept the inheritance. He
therefore got together all Cæsar’s papers, and began to spend Cæsar’s
immense fortune as only Antony could. He began also to manipulate
Cæsar’s papers, inserting anything he liked among Cæsar’s “acts,”
selling honours, raising taxes, recalling exiles to please Fulvia. For
some time no one ventured to complain. Leading senators like Cicero
retired to the country remarking that the tyrant was dead but the
tyranny still alive. Then, of course, Antony had to provide himself with
a province to ensure his future safety. Moreover, the cry of the
veterans for revenge began to move him to play the Cæsarian. Thus Antony
was virtually master of the Roman world and the sky was dark with
menace.</p>

<p>Into this dangerous arena steps the nineteen-year-old Octavian. His
guardian advised him to have nothing to do with his perilous
inheritance. Historians have often dubbed him a coward. But alone and
unfriended this youth left his tutors at Apollonia and came to Rome to
take up his trust. It meant, first, revenge upon the conspirators; and
secondly, a quarrel with Antony. It meant, in fact, two more civil wars,
and Octavian had seen nothing of warfare. He set to work coolly and
warily. There was still a magic in the name of Cæsar, and the veterans
rallied to him and besought him to march against Brutus and Cassius.
Part of his duties as executor was to pay a million sterling in
donations to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_128" id="page_128">{128}</a></span> Roman people. He sold his property and began to
distribute the largess, man by man, tribe by tribe, until the sum was
paid. He gave magnificent games in his “father’s” honour, with the lucky
star of Julius publicly exhibited. He bought an army of 10,000 men with
borrowed money. Two of Antony’s legions deserted to him bodily, and the
very veterans of Antony’s bodyguard offered to murder their general if
young Cæsar would give the signal.</p>

<p>But there was no haste in his method. Antony was to be used first and
then destroyed. Octavian tried for a time to work with the senate, and
even marched against Antony under their orders, but the incredible folly
of the senate, who were persuaded by Cicero that “the boy” was
negligible, drove him into the famous triple alliance of Antony,
Octavian, and Lepidus. These three were appointed under threat of their
armies to a kind of dictatorship in commission, “a triumvirate to
reorganise the state.” Revenge was the explicit motive of this league.
They began with the usual horrid proscription of all the senatorial
aristocrats to be found in Rome. This was mainly Antony’s work. His
creditors, his enemies and his wife’s enemies were slain wholesale, and,
among them, Cicero. Eighteen towns of Italy were destroyed to provide
lands for the veterans.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the tyrannicides had gathered in the East, and now Antony and
the young Cæsar set out in pursuit of them. In the two battles of
Philippi the luck of Octavian and the skill of Antony triumphed over
their dispirited adversaries. Brutus and Cassius fell. A few of the
“patriots” survived and joined Sextus Pompeius who was still at large in
the Mediterranean. In the warfare at Philippi Octavian’s inexperience
and real want of talent for generalship had been very apparent in
contrast to Antony. Lepidus was already a nonentity. Antony went off to
the East; and while he was holding his court of justice in Cilicia there
sailed into harbour the splendid royal yacht of Cleopatra. The people
left the judgment seat to see the famous Queen, and Antony too was soon
at her feet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_129" id="page_129">{129}</a></span> Signor Ferrero would have us believe, relying partly on
the mature age of Cleopatra, that it was policy, not love, which made
Antony dally at Alexandria. Policy no doubt was there, but everything
that we know of Antony leads us to believe that he was just the man to
be captured by a celebrated courtesan, particularly if she were also a
queen. Certainly his sojourn in the East lowered his character both as a
politician and as a soldier.</p>

<p>Octavian had to face Rome and the West. His task was full of perils but
also full of possibilities. The soldiers were mutinous, he himself was
grievously sick, and the redoubtable Fulvia, who was her husband’s real
agent at Rome, very soon perceived that he was an enemy to be fought.
Octavian had to fight another small civil war at Perugia before he could
call himself master even of Italy, and then fight Sextus Pompeius in the
Sicilian waters. Luckily he had at his side a splendid soldier&mdash;general
and admiral by turns as were all good Roman fighting-men&mdash;Marcus
Vipsanius Agrippa.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> He had also as his agent at Rome Mæcenas, an
astute diplomatist and man of business. So though he himself often
displayed feebleness and was often in danger he accomplished his task
and became master of the West. Thus the lordship of the world was
reduced to a plain duel.</p>

<p>Antony had actually married Cleopatra after Fulvia’s death and Octavia’s
divorce, and as consort of the Egyptian queen reigned in Oriental
majesty. He had marched against the Parthians and failed ignominiously.
He was assigning provinces and princedoms to Cleopatra and her dubious
offspring. It was easy for Octavian to represent Antony as a renegade
Roman threatening to introduce Oriental monarchy into Rome. When at last
it came to the final civil war Octavian appeared as fighting in the
public cause of Rome against Egypt, with Antony as a mere deserter on
the Egyptian side. The great naval battle of Actium (31 <small>B.C.</small>), which
decided the mastery of the world for Octavian, was thus a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_130" id="page_130">{130}</a></span> triumph for
the Roman arms over the barbarians. Actually it was a degenerate Antony
who sailed away at the crisis of the battle in the wake of the queen’s
yacht. The glory of the day was Agrippa’s. The luck as usual was the
young Cæsar’s. He was able to inaugurate his reign at Rome by presenting
her with Egypt, the richest country in the world. In 29 <small>B.C.</small> he came
home to celebrate a glorious triple triumph and to open a new era as the
first Roman Emperor.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Late Republican Civilisation</span></h3>

<p>Such is a brief sketch of the hundred and four years from the day when
Tiberius Gracchus first arose to challenge the senatorial oligarchy to
the day when the Empire was established upon the ruins of the Republic.
It is perhaps the most terrible century in the history of the world.
Rome had become the centre of the world, the only hope for civilisation,
and Rome was filled with bloodshed and corruption. For the provinces
there was no decent government, only a succession of licensed
plunderers. In the city itself there was a long series of personal
struggles for the mastery; politics meant organised rioting by gangs of
roughs, questions were solved by the dagger or by the swords of
senators. At intervals there came from each side alternately the
murderous proscriptions, in which every man of spirit or eminence on the
opposing side was marked down for destruction. Often their sons and
grandsons perished with them, and in any case their fortunes were
destroyed. Besides the proscriptions there had been of late a series of
civil wars on a great scale in which thousands of the bravest Romans
perished by each other’s swords. A successful foreign war may have some
compensating effect in stiffening the moral fibre of a nation and
exalting its spirit. But civil war is disastrous in every way. It is
only the meanest who survive and the evil passions which it arouses have
no compensation.</p>

<p>In such a period it is wonderful that civilisation should have been able
to make any advances at all. But in spite of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_131" id="page_131">{131}</a></span> the public turmoil private
citizens were amassing enormous fortunes out of the plunder of the
world, and living, though always on the edge of a volcano, in state and
luxury like kings. It is now our task to see something of private life
and culture in the Rome of the expiring Republic.</p>

<p>Money was easily made in those days and lavishly spent. Even an honest
man like Cicero, governing a comparatively poor province like Cilicia,
made at least £20,000 by his year of office while he remitted to the
provincials a million, which, as he says, any governor of average
morality would have retained. Legacies were a very frequent source of
revenue especially to pleaders, and it was customary for a rich testator
at Rome to make large bequests to his friends. Cicero gained £200,000 by
such legacies. Foreign kings and states paid handsomely for legal advice
or support. Although a barrister was supposed to give his services for
nothing yet gifts and legacies were not refused. For the financier or
business man there were many channels to affluence. There were mines all
over the empire to be financed and exploited. Although there was little
genuine industry at Rome, yet the training and use of slaves for various
undertakings was a lucrative business. Crassus trained a salvage brigade
for Rome and went about to fires with them in order to make bids for the
purchase of the burning property. Atticus trained a company of copying
clerks and made money by the sale of books. He also kept gladiators and
hired them out to magistrates for the games. Fortunes were made, as in
the case of Crassus, by buying up the confiscated property of the
proscribed. Land speculation was rendered extremely profitable by the
frequent assignation of farm-lands to veteran soldiers who were
generally glad to sell them at once. The extravagance of the Roman
nobles led to a very brisk traffic in loans at high interest. There was
a great deal of genuine commercial speculation in ships and cargoes,
generally by companies, and Cato advises the investor to put his money
in fifty different enterprises rather than in one at a time. Commerce
overseas<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_132" id="page_132">{132}</a></span> was, however, forbidden to the senators by the Claudian law,
and these speculated chiefly in land, on which they made a profit by
slave-labour. But the most profitable business of all was tax-farming,
in which the equestrian classes joined together in capitalist rings. In
these and other ways prodigious fortunes were accumulated. The stored-up
capital of the Roman world is astounding in its magnitude compared even
to that of modern times. The real property of Pompeius sold for
£700,000. Æsopus, the popular actor, left £200,000. After the most
lavish donations to the public Crassus left nearly two millions sterling
by will. On the death of Cæsar the treasury contained eight millions in
bullion of which a million was the dictator’s own property.</p>

<p>But all the wealth of the Roman empire was shared by a very narrow
circle. The gulf between rich and poor was far deeper than it is to-day.
We hear of poor nobles and rich upstarts, but of a respectable middle
class with traditions of its own there is little trace. There is an
aristocracy of a few thousand families, and nothing else but a vast
proletariat, silent and hungry, dependent on their bounty, bribed with
money, bribed with free corn, and bribed with bloody spectacles. They
lived miserably in huge tenement blocks or in hovels on the outskirts of
the city. The only career open to them was in the army, and that was
chiefly filled by the stronger rustics. They had nothing to do but
lounge in the streets, gape at gladiators and actors and shout for the
most generous politicians of the day. No doubt there were honest citizen
cobblers, but Roman history is silent about them.</p>

<p>That section of the city which is to be styled Society was as proud and
reckless as the French aristocracy before the Revolution. The senate had
now become almost literally a hereditary rank. A child born into one of
these princely houses was tended by a multitude of slaves. By this time
there was some attempt at a liberal education. Attended by a slave
pedagogue the boy would go daily to the school of some starved Greek,
who would teach him his letters and his figures. The staple<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_133" id="page_133">{133}</a></span> of
education was the delivery of artificial declamation on the model of
Isocrates or Demosthenes. After this stage a young man would commonly be
sent abroad to Athens or Rhodes to finish his education with a little
philosophy or mathematics, but chiefly with oratory. Returned to Rome,
his destiny placed him in a circle of foppish youths, who devoted their
principal attention to dress and manicure. Bejewelled and scented, they
practised every vice, natural and unnatural. In due course, with no
effort but a few bribes from the parental purse, they became priests and
augurs, thus entering what were in reality aristocratic dining-clubs.
Dining was now the principal art of Rome. Macrobius has preserved the
menu of one of these priestly dinners of the Republic, at which the
priests and vestals were present. The party began with a prolusion like
the Russian or Swedish system of <i>hors d’œuvres</i>, in which seventeen
dishes of fish and game were presented. The dinner itself contained ten
more courses, “sow’s udder, boar’s head, fish-pasties, boar-pasties,
ducks, boiled teals, hares, roasted fowls, starch-pastry,
Pontic-pastry.” Such was the State religion of Rome in the first century
before Christ. At intervals the young noble’s father’s friends would
invite him to join their staff on foreign service. If he had the good
fortune to serve with Pompeius or Lucullus in the East or with Cæsar in
Gaul, he might get a taste of real manliness, and serve his country as
tribune of the soldiers. But more often in a peaceful province like
Sicily or Africa he was merely initiated into the arts of extortion, and
enjoyed all the vicious opportunities of the younger sons of princes.
Thus fortified by experience he would return to Rome to seek the
suffrages of his fellow-citizens for the quæstorship, the first rung on
the ladder of office. Votes were to be won by bribery, direct or
indirect. One candidate would spread a banquet for a whole tribe;
another would seek to outshine his rivals by providing strange beasts
from Africa&mdash;among Cicero’s correspondence there is an urgent appeal for
Cilician panthers to be slain in the arena&mdash;or by dressing his
gladiators in silver armour. Similar requirements accompanied his
progress<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_134" id="page_134">{134}</a></span> through all the stages of office on a progressively lavish
scale. As quæstor he would be a judge or a comptroller of the treasury
for a single year. Then as ædile he would conduct the public festivals,
preside in the ædile’s court, control the markets and streets of Rome.
So he rose to be consul, commander of legions and president of the
state, and then in due course governor of an enormous province. From his
quæstorship onwards his seat in the senate was assured.</p>

<p>In his home the noble Roman lived like a king, waited upon by an
enormous retinue. There was much luxury and little comfort. The houses
of the Romans were on a far more luxurious scale than those of the
Greeks. The only genuine Roman taste that can be called liberal was the
hobby of collecting beautiful town houses and country seats. Cicero, who
was a man of modest income and tastes, seems to have possessed about
eighteen different estates, and gave nearly £30,000 for his town house.
The qualities prized in the choice of a mansion were space and coolness,
and the Romans of this age were by no means insensible to the charms of
scenery. The coast round Naples and Baiæ was dotted with sumptuous
villas, and the gay world spent its summer there in much the same way as
the cosmopolitan crowds at Biarritz. Besides his great town house and
his family mansion at Arpinum, and his country houses at Tusculum and
elsewhere, Cicero had marine villas all along the coast at Antium,
Formiæ, Cumæ, Puteoli, and Pompeii, and all along the Campanian road
were his private “inns,” where he lodged on his journeys. His favourite
villa was the one at Tusculum, the scene of many of his literary
labours, and among others of the famous Tusculan Disputations. It had
previously belonged to Sulla, and was adorned with paintings in
commemoration of Sulla’s victories. It was situated on the top of a hill
along with many other villas of the aristocracy, and commanded a
delightful view of the city about twelve miles away. The park attached
to it was extensive, and through it there ran a broad canal. He had
books everywhere, but his principal library was deposited at Antium. At
Puteoli<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_135" id="page_135">{135}</a></span> he constructed a cloister and a grove on the model of Plato’s
Academy.</p>

<p>The principal feature of the Roman house was its large colonnaded hall,
with a roof open in the middle to admit light and air. This roof sloped
inwards, and allowed the rain to fall into a central tank, delightful
for coolness, no doubt, but probably very unwholesome. In old days the
atrium had been the common room of the Roman family. It still retained a
symbolical marriage-bed, a symbolical spinning-wheel, the portraits of
the ancestors, and the ceremonial altar to the family gods, who were now
stored away in a cupboard close at hand. Most of the rooms opened
directly out of the atrium. As they are seen in the ruins of Roman
villas, they appear to have been comparatively small and ill-lighted.
The larger houses themselves were generally built of local limestone
with facings of stucco, though the greater part of Rome was still in
this first century b.c. constructed of sun-baked bricks. It was
considered unheard-of luxury when Mamurra faced his walls with marble
slabs. The floors were generally tessellated. It was an innovation of
the Roman architect to build houses of three or more stories, but it was
probably only a starveling poet who would live on the fourth floor. A
noble’s house would spread over the ground regardless of space, but the
bedrooms and sometimes the dining-room were upstairs. Externally the
Roman house was a little finer than the Greek, being fronted with a
pillared forecourt and a dwelling for the concierge. At the back the
atrium opened into a colonnaded garden with a fountain, flower-beds, and
shrubbery.</p>

<p>As the Roman’s house was built mainly with a view to coolness, so his
daily life was that of a southerner. Rome was never a healthy city in
the summer, and all who could afford it fled to the country or the
sea-side. Almost every Roman known to us in literature was either an
invalid or a valetudinarian. Malarial fever in its periodic form was
very widely spread, and most of our distinguished friends pursued a
medical regimen. Cæsar was subject to fits of epilepsy, Cicero<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_136" id="page_136">{136}</a></span> was of
weak constitution, Horace was a martyr to ophthalmia as well as malaria,
Augustus was always ailing and often at death’s door. The Roman’s most
amiable idiosyncrasy was his devotion to the bath. Every considerable
house had an elaborate bathing department with at least a hot room built
over a furnace, and a cold room with a swimming-tank. But there were
also public baths, on an ever-increasing scale of magnificence. Agrippa
alone built 170 of them at Rome. Rich and poor alike made it their daily
practice to bathe after exercise, just before their principal meal in
the early afternoon. The custom of the noon-tide siesta was universal,
except with prodigies of industry like Cicero. A great deal of time was
spent in lounging abroad through the streets or under shady colonnades.
The streets of Rome, as of all ancient cities, were extremely narrow,
but in the busy parts of the city all wheeled traffic was forbidden.</p>

<p>The wealthy Romans have a name for abominable luxury and gluttony. As to
the general question of its influence in destroying the morality of Rome
I have already ventured to express disbelief in the popular view. From
all that we read, it does not appear that the ordinary Roman was
naturally addicted to intemperance either in eating or drinking. The
praise of wine is with Horace a literary pose; personally he had a poor
head and a poor stomach. The Italian is not, and probably never was a
great natural eater or drinker judged by northern standards. But
rhetoricians and satirists have delighted to dwell upon the immensity of
Roman dinner-parties which often lasted all day and included a hideous
series of curious and exotic dainties. This was the form which, in
default of any nobler ideals, wealth at Rome had chosen for its display.
Time hung heavily on this slave-tended aristocracy: to dine from dawn to
daylight was one of the ways of killing it. So the guests reclined on
their couches, dancers jigged before them, musicians played,
occasionally a tumbler or a tight-rope walker would appear, in literary
households a slave would read philosophy; and all the time the
soft-footed slaves were coming and going with dishes of strange morsels
gathered<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_137" id="page_137">{137}</a></span> from the ends of the earth, and rare wines from the four
corners of the globe. A dish of nightingales’ tongues is not the sort of
thing to please one who is a <i>gourmet</i> by conviction or natural taste.
Eating was for most of these poor starved imaginations the only form of
culture they understood. It was, however, conducted with tremendous
ceremony. There was a “tricliniarch” to marshal his “decuries” of slaves
as each dish came into the room. There was a special “structor” to
arrange the dishes, a special “analecta” to pick up the fragments that
the diners dropped. Carving was a science with various branches, as in
old England, and the skilful carver had his scheme of gesticulations for
each kind of dish. There was another slave specially appointed to cry
out the name and quality of each <i>plat</i>. In addition to these every
guest had his own footman standing behind his couch. The most
characteristic and the most unpleasant feature of a Roman banquet was
the manner in which the diners assisted nature to provide them with an
appetite. Even Julius Cæsar “took his vomit” both before and after his
dinner-party with Cicero.</p>

<p>The public shows, which formed the chief recreation of rich and poor
alike, grew yearly more brutal and bloody. As they were the means by
which ambitious candidates for office sought to canvass popularity, the
principal aim was to present something novel and startling. No doubt the
more refined spectators regarded the butchery of wild beasts or paid
gladiators with disgust, but the populace at large only shouted for more
blood. Five hundred lions were slaughtered on one day at the triumphal
games given by Pompeius. Cicero writes that the wholesale destruction of
elephants in the arena actually moved the people to pity. There were
still some real theatrical performances in Rome. Actors and mimics,
indeed, if they were handsome and graceful, made large fortunes. Most
Roman nobles of a literary bent amused themselves with writing
tragedies. Cicero’s soldier brother composed four on a fortnight’s
journey to Gaul. But these were only employed to bore one’s friends at
dinner. Original literary dramas were even<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_138" id="page_138">{138}</a></span> less often staged at Rome
than they are in London. Plautus and Terence for comedy, and Pacuvius,
Attius, and Ennius for tragedy, had already become classics and were
still regularly performed. The drama died stillborn at Rome.</p>

<p>Historians of Rome, fortified by Juvenal and Petronius, love to depict
the vices of the emperors and the imperial period. The later Republic
can show us a morality no more exalted. The fragments of Varro’s satires
written in the heyday of the Republic are in precisely the same strain
of despondency as are the satires of Juvenal. For him, too, virtue is a
thing of the past. Sober fact compels us to see that the aristocratic
society of Republican Rome was hideously immoral. Voluntary celibacy and
“race-suicide” were already rife. The family was a decaying institution,
divorce was common, and the sterility of wickedness had long been at
work to sap the ranks of the nobility. Even Cicero divorced his wife
Terentia upon a trivial pretext after a long period of happy conjugal
life in order to marry an heiress. Cæsar had four wives of his own, not
to mention Cleopatra, without begetting a single legitimate son. Cato,
the strict censor of morals, having been jilted in his youth, married a
wife, divorced her for adultery after she had borne him two sons,
married another, lent her for six years to the orator Hortensius, and on
his death resumed her again. Mark Antony married Fadia, then Antonia,
then divorced her and lived publicly with Cytheris the actress, then
married Fulvia, who had already been twice a widow, then married
Octavia, then Cleopatra. These marriages were made and dissolved freely
for political reasons. A large part of Roman politics was carried on in
the salons of the Roman ladies, and if half of what Cicero alleges be
true Messalina herself had her republican prototypes in women like
Clodia and Fulvia. Beside almost promiscuous relations between the
sexes, the darker forms of Oriental vice were extremely fashionable
among the gilded youth of Rome.</p>

<p>Religion was almost purely formal or political. Augurships and
priesthoods still existed as the perquisite of aristo<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_139" id="page_139">{139}</a></span>cratic families.
People still uttered the formulæ of oaths and vows. There was still some
belief in omens and prodigies, the altars still smoked with sacrifice
when triumphant generals went up to the capitol, but few prayers
ascended to Jupiter in sincerity. Instead the importation of strange
deities continued. Again and again in this first century before Christ
the senate tried to expel the worship of Isis from the precincts of
Rome, but it always returned, and eventually the triumvirs built a
temple to Isis and Serapis as a measure to court popular favour. The
Magna Mater of the Phrygian corybants had long been firmly established
at Rome.</p>

<p>I think it was general materialism and immorality which killed the old
State religion at Rome. Greek philosophy had generally been able to
exist amicably by the side of religion. It now came in to fill up the
gap left by the absence of real religious feeling. But at Rome, though
Stoicism afterwards became a powerful force of inspiration to the
noblest minds, philosophy was in the main a form of literary activity
for dilettantists. Cato of Utica was a Stoic by temperament before he
became one by doctrine. Cicero amused his leisure by recasting and
combining the doctrines of the leading Greek schools in a Roman form of
dialogue, in imitation of Plato; but with him it was more of a literary
exercise than anything else, and Cicero has added little or nothing to
the world’s stock of philosophical ideas. Only in the poet Lucretius
does the fire of philosophy burn with genuine ardour. Lucretius had
before him the task of proselytising at Rome for the doctrines of
Epicurus and Democritus. People accustomed to the modern associations of
the word “epicure” may wonder what there was to arouse the enthusiasm of
a poet in the philosophy of Epicurus. That creed offered a rational
explanation of the universe. With its theory of spontaneous atomic
creation, and its surprising foreknowledge of some at least of the ideas
of natural selection and evolution, it claimed to satisfy the intellect
of mankind and to drive out all the grovelling superstition and empty
rites which had usurped at Rome, as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_140" id="page_140">{140}</a></span> tend to do always and
everywhere, the throne of religion. All the enthusiasm with which the
nineteenth century approached the new discoveries of science glowed in
the heart of this rugged poet of the first century before Christ.
“Voluptas” was his only goddess, but it was no vulgar pleasure of the
body upon earth. It was the spirit soaring to freedom and knowledge.
This atheist Epicurean is, in the true sense of the word, the most
religious of all poets. He explains the nature of lightning in order
that his fellow-creatures may not live in fear of thunderbolts. He
explains with the same confident logic the nature of death in order that
they may not fear the natural resolution of body and soul into their
primordial atoms. He is moved almost to tears by the folly and sorrow of
his brother-men, and he pleads with them to suffer the sacred lamp of
philosophy to shine upon their darkened minds:</p>

<p class="nind">Lucretius was, of course, set down by Cicero, as was Shakespeare by
Dryden, as being rude and unpolished. His poem is indeed sheer didactic
argument with occasional digressions, and he strings his points together
with the bald transitional words and phrases of argumentative prose. But
in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_142" id="page_142">{142}</a></span> virility of thought and expression, even in majesty of sound and
force of vivid imagery, he is, when he cares to be, on a plane quite
above and away from the ordinary sphere of classic Latin poetry. Almost
alone among Roman writers he has a message of his own to deliver. His
fellow-countrymen thought little of him, and failed to preserve any
details of his biography. The monks of the Middle Ages consigned him to
the hell he had flouted, and Jerome provided him, five hundred years
after his death, with an end edifying to piety, but quite incredible to
any one who has read his work with sympathy. He was said to have died of
a love potion, and to have composed his poem in the intervals of
delirium. He appears to have lived between 100 and 50 <small>B.C.</small></p>

<p>In addition to the tragedies and epics which noblemen threw off as an
elegant pastime for their superfluous leisure hours, love-poetry,
pasquinades, and <i>vers de société</i> travelled merrily from salon to
salon. If Lucretius carries the heaviest metal of Latin poets, Catullus
has by far the lightest touch. He writes with an ease which makes Horace
seem laboured, and with a simplicity which makes Propertius and even
Ovid look like pedants, though Catullus himself, like all Romans,
thought fit occasionally to adopt the classical pose, and fill his
verses with learned allusions. If it were not for the influence of the
schoolroom, to which most of Catullus’s work is for the best of reasons
unknown, he would be recognised as possessing far more of the vital
spark of poetry than Horace. Roman culture, being mainly second-hand, is
almost entirely lacking in the quality of fresh youth which we enjoy in
such writers as Chaucer and the early Elizabethan singers. Catullus,
therefore, the earliest important lyric poet of Rome, is by no means
unsophisticated. On the contrary, he is a clever son of the <i>forum</i>&mdash;a
boulevardier, one might say&mdash;with a pretty but savage wit in reviling
democrats like Cæsar and Mamurra. But, with his truly Italian
scurrility, he combines the quintessence of Italian charm. When the
inspiration takes him he is simple, direct, and natural. Indeed, the
shorter poems of Catullus seem to me to reveal more of the</p>

<p class="nind">The music of this, with its beautiful imagery and refrains, is no doubt
based upon an Alexandrian foundation. There is a distinct echo of
Theocritus. But it is also distinctively Italian, and the greatest of
modern Italian poets, Carducci, writes like a legitimate descendant of
Catullus. Catullus has as little biography as Lucretius. He must have
died at an early age in the fifties <small>B.C.</small> He was a poor man. He had only
a town house and two villas, one on the Lago di Garda and one at Tivoli.
He hated Cæsar and loved Cicero. That his “Lesbia” was the infamous
Clodia is generally asserted. I do not believe it.</p>

<p>These two poets, Lucretius and Catullus, then, stand almost alone as
representatives of Republican Roman literature on the poetical side.
Both are Romanising various Alexandrian Greek modes, but both have
something genuinely Roman, a quality which we may best describe as
virility, to add to their originals. This was the point from which a
genuine Roman literature might have taken its departure. Instead of
that, the next era is that of a courtly school of classicists, largely
writing to order, who gave to Latin its distinctively classical bent.</p>

<p>Cicero, the most classical of all classics, is, however, far the
greatest literary product of the Republic. He is, indeed, far too vast a
figure for these modest pages. By his colossal industry and immense
fertility of genius his influence dominates the whole field of Latin
prose literature. He is not only the greatest of all orators, but he
stands as the type of the orator in life as in literature. We of this
generation, who live in the eclipse of rhetoric, do not find it easy to
be just to him. With such gifts of eloquence, such a power of uttering
tremendous<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_145" id="page_145">{145}</a></span> phrases about duty and patriotism, we cannot but feel
affronted at his political incapacity. Mommsen, who is all for action,
peppers him with contemptuous expressions&mdash;“a statesman without insight,
opinion or purpose”; “a short-sighted egoist”; “a journalist of the
worst description”; “his lawyer’s talent of finding excuses&mdash;or, at any
rate, words&mdash;for everything.” And, indeed, among men like Cæsar with
legions at their backs, or creatures like Clodius with their packs of
hooligans, a man of golden words and honest principles does cut a sorry
figure on the pages of history&mdash;so much the worse for history! He had,
as we have seen, a policy, his talents made him a leader among the
moderates of the senate, and his character made him genuinely popular
among all the more respectable classes of society. But Rhetoric is one
of the feminine Muses, and Cicero’s nature was as soft and sympathetic
as a woman’s. So he turns his coat at a word from Pompeius, utters brave
words one day and eats them on the next, publishes magnificent
denunciations which he has not had the courage to deliver. Moreover, we
see his intimate thoughts revealed in all the frankness of an
unexpurgated private correspondence&mdash;and there are few statesmen,
certainly very few orators, whose reputations can sustain that test.
Thus the golden words often ring hollow. His vanity is often ludicrous,
as when he writes to Lucceius, to beseech a conspicuous place in his
history, even if the truth has to be distorted for the purpose; or when
he loiters at Brundisium, with his lictors’ rods continually wreathed in
laurel for the futile hope of a triumph. Certainly he was an egoist.
Probably in their private correspondence all men are. But he was also a
gentleman, one of the few Romans of his day with whom one would care to
shake hands in Elysium.</p>

<p>To Mommsen, Cæsar is the “sole creative genius” of Roman history. We may
well ask what he created. Certainly not the empire, for that fell to
pieces at his death, and had to be re-created on a new plan by his
successor. Not even the Gallic province, for though he conquered it, he
left the problem of its organisation to Augustus. Possibly the <i>Lex<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_146" id="page_146">{146}</a></span>
Julia municipalis</i>. But Cicero<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> created Latin prose out of next to
nothing and left it to the world as its grandest form of literary
expression. The splendid Latin period, with its clear logical order, its
chain of dependent clauses each in its place with absolute precision, a
thought built of words as a temple is built of marble, is the best
expression of Roman grandeur, as typical and as enduring as a Roman road
or wall. It was not mere art. It was the natural expression of a Roman
mind trained in law and rhetoric. It was perhaps the finest thing the
Romans ever made, and the Latin period is the true justification for
retaining Latin in its place for the education of young barbarians
accustomed to string their random ideas together like dish-clouts on a
line. Although it was the result of long training under all the most
distinguished masters of Rome and Greece, and was perfected with
infinite labour, Cicero’s style, when once achieved, was extraordinarily
rapid and fluent, as the number of his works can testify. It is true
that, like many great stylists&mdash;Dryden, for example&mdash;he came to believe
that style was everything. He was prepared to write a geography of the
world or a history of Rome. He only wanted a few notes from his brother
Quintus to write an account of Britain. His multitudinous philosophical
works were, as we have seen, more style than philosophy, thrown off in a
few months to while away the time at his Tusculan villa at intervals
when the temperature of Rome, literally or politically, was too high to
suit his health. In such work he may fairly be called a journalist,
though a very great one. When he writes of a subject he really
understands, such as rhetoric, he is at his best. Again, in his forensic
speeches or writings he is much better as an advocate than as a lawyer.
His mind is not capable of juristic precision, he is neither deep nor
subtle, and so far his influence is wholly detrimental in the history of
Roman law. He would probably infuriate a trained judge; but give him a
jury, and, if possible, a large Italian one, and he is irresistible, now
with translucent rapid narra<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_147" id="page_147">{147}</a></span>tive, now with clever mystification,
breaking off into thundering appeals to conscience or heaven, or again
with passionate denunciation of his opponent or majestic encomium for
his client. In the senate he is not at his best. We are told that a few
blunt words from Cato had more power to move that assembly of practical
men than all the Catilinarian orations. But if Rome had been governed as
Greece was, by orations in the market-place, Cicero would have been in
Cæsar’s place as dictator of the world. Imagine the Roman mob assembling
in 63 <small>B.C.</small> to hear their consul’s account of Catiline’s flight&mdash;</p>

<p>“Why, you did not even stamp your foot!” he exclaims in rebuking the
coolness of an opposing counsel. It is true that there were purists of
the severer school of Roman oratory who thought such vehemence
meretricious and undignified. The true Roman eloquence of the old school
is to be found in that ambassador who came to the Carthaginian senate
with “peace or war,” gathered in the folds of his mantle and briefly
commanded them to choose; or that other who drew a circle in the dust
round the Great King and demanded an answer before he left the circle.
Cicero had studied his art both in the flowery Asiatic and the severer
Attic schools. There was still, his critics complained, too much Asia in
his style. But that was part of the tendency of his age. The austerity
of Cato, with his simple formulæ, was gone for ever. The Romans of this
age are more emotional, more sentimental, more characteristically
Southern.</p>

<p>If we reproach Cicero with weakness and cowardice in his political life,
the story of his end may atone for it. After Cæsar’s murder, when Antony
was master of Rome, a man utterly unscrupulous and wedded to a still
more unscrupulous wife, Cicero flung away all his timidity and
hesitation. Convinced that the consul was trying to re-establish a
monarchy, the old orator came down to the senate and launched at him the
series of ferocious but most eloquent philippics. Some were spoken, some
merely written and published. It was courting death in the cause of
liberty. Cicero was not blind to the danger he was running. But he is
probably sincere when he says that life has no more attractions for him.</p>

<p>As he foresaw so plainly, the philippics caused his doom. When the
triumvirate drew up its proscription-lists, Octavian is said to have
pleaded for his life. But Antony’s wrath was implacable. Cicero’s head
and his hands were nailed to the rostra from which he had so often
poured out his rhetoric, and the virago Fulvia, so the story goes,
thrust her needle through his eloquent, venomous tongue.</p>

<p>Julius Cæsar, that miracle of energy, beside being a competent
grammarian and no mean poet, was reputed the second of Roman orators. Of
that we have little means of judging. Certainly he could quell a mutiny
by a speech, and his Commentaries were not the least wonderful of his
achievements. Professedly they are mere notes for a real historian&mdash;by
“historian” the Romans always meant “orator”&mdash;to dress up for
literature. They are mere despatches intended to inform the senate and
the world of the progress of his campaigns. They were written at odd
moments in a prodigiously active life. Their style is so simple and so
correct that we cast them as pearls before the fourth-form schoolboy.
Yet they are in reality a triumphant product of the rhetorical art; so
simple, they must be honest; so modest, they must be candid. You would
scarcely think that they are a defence or a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_150" id="page_150">{150}</a></span> vindication. In the same
easy flow of narrative breathless escapes are concealed. Who remembers
from his schooldays Cæsar’s description of that moment, so pregnant with
human destiny, when the eagle first alighted on our shores in the hands
of the gallant centurion of the Tenth Legion? Cæsar seems more like a
Greek than a Roman in his directness as in his reticence. Fortunately
for history Cæsar had far more natural curiosity than most of the
Romans. It is surprising how little Cicero really tells us of Roman or
Cilician life in all his voluminous correspondence. But Cæsar went out
to explore as well as to conquer. It may even be true that his visit to
Britain was, as he asserts, partly due to curiosity. He notes our little
insular peculiarities&mdash;our custom of sharing wives, our habit of keeping
the hare, the hen, and the goose as pets because our religion forbids us
to eat them. He sees the superior civilisation of Kent. He observes our
clothing of skins, our dyeing ourselves blue with woad, our long hair
and moustaches, our horsemen and charioteers, our innumerable population
and crowded buildings, our plenteous store of cattle, our
metals&mdash;bronze, iron, and tin. He is equally observant in Gaul and
Germany. The debt that history owes to him for these records is
incalculable.</p>

<p>Lesser lights such as Sallust and Nepos dabbled in history and have had
the good fortune to survive. Livy, though he wrote under Augustus, is a
true Republican in mind and sympathy. His majestic history of Rome is
the work of a rhetorician setting out to extol the glories of the
Republic. Although he sometimes displays a rudimentary critical instinct
in comparing his authorities, his main task was to Latinise Polybius and
to embellish with first-century style the dry annals of Fabius Pictor
and Licinius Macer. It is not the least of our many grievances against
the monks that they allowed so much of Livy to disappear.</p>

</div>

<p>The golden age of classical literature covers this last half-century of
the Republic and the first half-century of the Empire. There is, on the
whole, little trace of division<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_151" id="page_151">{151}</a></span> between the general character of
Republican and Imperial letters except that with Augustus the principal
writers are definitely engaged under the Emperor’s banner of reform. The
main characteristic of both is rhetoric and convention. It is to
Alexandria and its state-fostered writing-club that the world owes
convention in literature. The Romans drew their inspiration from Greece
but mainly from Alexandria, and as literature at Rome was now chiefly in
the hands of a clique of nobles it was possible for a classical style to
grow strong there. Cicero and his friends evolved a style, not only of
literature but even of thought, which could pronounce itself as
“urbane,” and all else as barbarian or rustic. Roman literature of the
first centuries before and after Christ was as much under the domination
of epithets like “urbane” and “humane” as was the literature of the
eighteenth century under “elegant” and “ingenious.” Even Livy as an
outsider was suspected of mingling “Patavinity” with his Latinity. It is
the aristocracies of literature, such as the court of Louis XIV. or of
Charles II., or such as the coffee-house cliques of Addison’s day or the
Johnsonian clubs, which create and maintain our periods of classical
convention.</p>

<p>Literature, as we have already seen occasion to remark, since it works
in the most plastic medium, is generally the first of the arts to
develop; and literature is only yet beginning. But then Rome borrowed
her arts wholesale from Greece, and thus her culture has no true
infancy. The burning problem of Roman originality in Art must be
reserved until we reach the Augustan age. For the present we must still
deny the existence of any really spontaneous art growth at Rome during
the Republic. Where native art may be looked for with the highest
probability of finding it is in architecture, portrait-sculpture, and
painting; in architecture, partly because the Romans had a natural
passion for building and partly because their religious and social
habits called for quite distinct types of construction in palaces,
halls, amphitheatres, triumphal arches, <i>fora</i>, and other secular
buildings upon which the Greeks<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_152" id="page_152">{152}</a></span> had wasted little of their attention;
in portraiture because it was a peculiar custom at Rome to make and
display images of their ancestors, whereas the Greeks in their love of
the ideal had until latterly shrunk from the presentation of casual
human lineaments and still idealised them as far as possible, and also
because the Etruscans, who were the first nurses of Roman culture, had
developed portraiture for themselves; and in painting, partly owing to
the same Etruscan influence and partly because the Romans, using
inferior building materials such as brick, limestone, and terra-cotta
covered with stucco, were naturally drawn to mural painting for the sake
of ornament. But if we look for originality here we are disappointed.
Undoubtedly hundreds of magnificent villas were being run up all over
Italy from Como to Sorrento, but a Roman villa was more an affair of
landscape gardening than of architecture. It consisted mainly of a
series of courts and colonnades sprawling at large over the ground. The
walls were built of coarse tufa or peperino; they were only just
beginning to be incrusted with marble slabs. As a city Rome was still
contemptible&mdash;a huddled mass of narrow, tortuous alleys. Augustus swept
away as much of it as he could afford to demolish, and his historians
remark that “he found Rome built of brick and left it built of marble.”
There were of course ancient temples, venerable with dignity, and no
doubt to us they would have seemed beautiful with the picturesqueness of
antiquity. But with Gracchans and Marians and Clodians rioting at large
through the city, many of these venerable shrines were destroyed by
fire. The Roman ruins as seen by the modern traveller are almost all of
Imperial times. The great Temple of Jupiter on the Capitol was rebuilt
four times. The round temple of Vesta was frequently destroyed and
restored. Although for religious reasons the plan of the original was
generally preserved in these rebuildings, the details were in accordance
with the style of the day. Nevertheless the plans are interesting. The
round shrines of Vesta and Mater Matuta<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> are clearly an
archi<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_153" id="page_153">{153}</a></span>tectural development from a round hut constructed of wood with a
thatched roof. Indeed the Temple of Vesta is said to have been modelled
on the hut of Romulus. It was perhaps originally the king’s house in
which the princesses tended the sacred fire. The Temple of Jupiter
Capitolinus also was, if we may trust the coins, built on an un-Greek
plan with three naves instead of a single nave with aisles.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>The only two considerable relics of Republican architecture are the
Tabularium and the Temple of Fortuna Virilis, both dating from the
period of Sulla. In that period, when Rome had just discovered Greek
culture, when the armies of Sulla and Lucullus came home laden with
Greek spoil, there was a temporary outburst of artistic activity at
Rome. It was, however, entirely in the hands of foreign artists. In 143,
Metellus, the victor of Macedonia, built the first marble temple at Rome
in the Campus Martius. Sulla himself carried off the huge columns of the
unfinished temple of Olympian Zeus at Athens to adorn the Roman Capitol.
The Cyprian Greek Hermodorus was employed to construct temples and
docks. The Romans had indeed their native principles of building, which
from a merely constructive point of view were in advance of anything
that the Greeks had evolved for themselves. Greek architecture of the
best period had been almost exclusively devoted to the service of
religion. Their efforts were almost limited to the perfecting of the
Doric and Ionic temple, and when they had to build a secular building
like the gate of the Acropolis, they were still content with a mere
adaptation of Doric temple to their new purpose. Their building material
was marble, and with their peculiar artistic discretion the Greeks saw
that marble was at its best in the austere lines of pediment and
columns. But the Romans, before they imported marble, had made a
beginning with brick and cement, which require quite different methods
of architecture. In prehistoric “Servian” days they had discovered or
learnt from the Etruscans the use of the vault and arch, at any rate for
tunnels, but it is characteristic of their artistic poverty that they
had made little architectural use of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_154" id="page_154">{154}</a></span> these important principles. The
triumphal arch seems to have been a Roman invention, and several
triumphal arches were built in republican days, but unfortunately we
have no information as to their style. The Sullan revival of art was
purely an importation of foreign models. In the Temple of Fortuna
Virilis built in 78 <small>B.C.</small> we see how the Romans used their imported
architecture.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> The graceful Ionic columns support nothing. They are
used for ornament as the West African native uses his European clothes.
The Greeks had indeed used engaged columns, as in the Erechtheum, to
complete the design where there was no space for a free colonnade, but
the Romans built them into their walls for the sake of ornament. This is
typical. Culture was to the Greeks a vital part of their existence, to
the Romans it was an embellishment.</p>

<p>But Roman architecture, having made this effort, had relapsed again
until the days of the Cæsars. There was more destroying than building in
the evil days of Cicero’s prime. The selfish plutocrats were too busy
building their villas to give a thought to the gods’ or the city’s
adornment.</p>

<p>It was much the same with the other arts. Take the coins, for example.
The clumsy copper <i>As</i>, with the head of Janus on the obverse and the
prow of a ship on the reverse,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> had of old weighed 12 ounces. All
through republican history it was gradually shrinking; in 217 <small>B.C.</small> it
was fixed at one ounce, in 89 <small>B.C.</small> at half an ounce. Long before that,
however, silver had taken its place. As we have remarked, silver was not
coined, though no doubt it circulated, at Rome before 268 <small>B.C.</small>. From 217
onwards silver became the real standard of value, and about 80 <small>B.C.</small> the
copper coinage ceased altogether for a time. Not only were the original
designs of the “heavy copper” borrowed from Greece, but there is not the
least sign in the Roman coinage of any artistic development as time
progresses. Simply, as Head remarks, “the degree of excellence attained
in any particular district depended upon the closeness of its relations,
direct or indirect, with some Greek city, or at least with<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_155" id="page_155">{155}</a></span> a population
imbued with the spirit of Greek art.” There are coins of Sulla, both
silver and gold, doubtless of Greek workmanship, which display fairly
artistic designs.[33] But the coins of Antony and Cleopatra, interesting
as they are historically, and designed, of course, in the Hellenised
East, are much inferior.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> We notice an attempt at portraiture, but
the striking resemblance between the Roman triumvir and the Egyptian
queen suggests the question which of the pair was the original.</p>

<p>In sculpture, too, the most ardent supporters of Roman originality can
find little to comfort them in the closing century of the Republic. We
have seen how the victories of Mummius and his successors had created a
taste and a market for Greek works of art. With those of Sulla and
Lucullus immense quantities of loot had crossed the Adriatic, and Rome
began to be what New York is now, the home of connoisseurs and
collectors. As connoisseurs are wont to do, the Roman millionaires
studied commercial values rather than artistic qualities. No doubt in
time their taste improved from the days when Mummius had warned his men
that any of the Greek masterpieces destroyed in transit would have to be
replaced by new ones. But they still went very largely by the names of
the artists: a genuine Praxiteles or Scopas was worth immense sums.
Every villa now required statues for its adornment&mdash;Greek originals, if
possible; if not, copies. For the most part they were reckoned purely as
objects of value along with handsome tables, vases, bowls, and
signet-rings. When Cicero buys Greek statues he prefers Muses to
Bacchantes as being more appropriate to his studies. The question of
artistic value scarcely enters his mind. The most famous named sculptor
of this period is the Italian-Greek Pasiteles, who visited Rome about 90
<small>B.C.</small> and there made original statues for Roman temples. Pasiteles, of
course, was of the Hellenic decline. He was a metal-worker by training,
and his work is like that of Cellini, more decorative than creative. It
is<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_156" id="page_156">{156}</a></span> jewellery on a large scale. He evolved no new style of his own, but
set himself to copy and elaborate ancient types to meet the artificial
demand for antiquities. Many of the “archaistic” works in our museums
belong to this period of production, and as decoration many of them are
extremely charming. We have other names of the Pasitelean school, all
Greek, such as Stephanus and Menelaus, but there is very little
originality or interest in them. The Venus Genetrix in the Louvre is
undoubtedly a fine statue, and is probably a faithful copy of the
original by Arcesilaus of the first century <small>B.C.</small><a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> But the face, at
any rate, quite visibly goes back to the Greek sculpture of the fifth
century, and perhaps, as has been suggested, to Alcamenes. It is in the
treatment of the transparent drapery that the present artist shows his
skill. Skill there was in abundance in those Greek chisels of the first
century; even the Farnese Hercules of Glycon and the Medici Venus<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
are astonishing as efforts of chisel-craft, utterly debased and debasing
as they are.</p>

<p>We know from history that portrait statues had long been common at Rome.
The forum was full of them. We saw in an earlier chapter how the old
Etruscans had placed terra-cotta portraits of the deceased upon their
tombs, and how the old Romans preserved wax images of their forefathers
for use at funerals. Most primitive peoples have an instinctive dread of
portraiture as a sort of blasphemy. Perhaps the early growth of facial
portraiture at Rome was helped by the worship of a man’s <i>genius</i>, his
luck, his spirit, his guardian angel. The genius naturally was depicted
in the likeness of the man himself. So the <i>imagines</i> in a Roman atrium
were no mere portraits of defunct ancestors. Rather they were visible
presentments of invisible presences. Unfortunately very few
unquestionably genuine examples of republican portraiture have survived.
Portraits of ancient celebrities were freely constructed at all times,
and it is not easy to date them. We have not at Rome as we have in
Greece a clear line of artistic<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_157" id="page_157">{157}</a></span> development which enables the trained
archæologist to date any casual work of art to within half a century
almost at a glance. It is now a question of employing more or less
skilful Greeks. It is probable that most of the portraits already
illustrated in this book were executed under the Cæsars, but they may
well go back to earlier if ruder likenesses, and in any case the
portraits are interesting for their own sake. The portraits of Julius
Cæsar, both the white marble bust in the Vatican Museum<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> and the
still more striking example in black basalt in the Barracco Museum at
Rome, are, however, almost certainly of contemporary or, at the latest,
Augustan date, so real and vivid is the portraiture. There is another
very fine black basalt head of Julius in Berlin,<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> but its
authenticity has been questioned. It certainly corresponds very closely
with the profile of the dictator on his coins.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> The bust of M. Brutus
may also be identified by comparison with the coins. That of Cicero is
probable but not so certain.</p>

<p>This art of realistic portraiture, then, is claimed as the great
contribution of ancient Rome to artistic progress. It yet remains to be
shown that any part of the work was done by native artists. At present
the evidence is all in favour of Greek authorship. But the Romans may
claim the credit of demanding or even inspiring realism. Roman
archæologists, especially those who, like Wickhoff and Mrs. Strong, are
concerned to plead the cause of Roman originality in art, often seem to
assume that the Greeks of the best period could not express
individuality, in fact that the ideal tendency of their statues,
portraits included, is due to convention if not to the sheer limitations
of their craftsmanship. Elsewhere we have seen that much of the apparent
simplicity of Greek work of the best period is really elaborate
self-restraint. All their religious ideas forbade them to express
divinity with any marks of time or place upon face or feature. So when
it came&mdash;as it came slowly&mdash;to portraying a statesman like Pericles, or
a monarch like Alexander, they deliberately honoured them by<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_158" id="page_158">{158}</a></span> idealising
them and smoothing away the accidentals. Thus they concealed the
inordinately long skull of Pericles by depicting him in a helmet. They
could be realistic enough when they chose to be, but that was never in
the adornment of temples except just so far as to indicate the barbarity
of Centaurs or Giants in contrast to the perfection of the Greek.
Myron’s Cow has perished without offspring, but the slave-boys on the
tombstones are realistic enough&mdash;to say nothing of the Ludovisi Reliefs.
Realism was no new discovery of the Romans. On the contrary, so far as
it was an innovation it was an act of indulgence, a breaking down of
self-imposed barriers. Even then, was it inspired by any abstract
passion for the naked truth, such as moved Cromwell to command his
portrait-painter to include the warts? Not entirely. The Romans were a
rhetorical, not a realistic people. I believe that Roman realism in
portraiture is chiefly due to the national custom of preserving the
<i>imagines</i> taken from the death-masks of the illustrious dead. On Greek
soil the Greek artists were still idealising their portraits&mdash;witness
the fine head of Mithradates on the coins of Pontus;<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> but when their
Roman sitters asked for realism they gave it&mdash;gave it sometimes with the
unexpected thoroughness of Mr. Sargent. Besides coins and statues there
are very fine portraits on the gems of the first century <small>B.C.</small></p>

<p>Towards painting too we saw that the Romans had inherited some
traditional bent. We hear of Greek painters highly esteemed at Rome in
this period as well as of imported Greek pictures fetching enormous
prices. The Romans loved colour, and their villa walls were commonly
stuccoed and painted, if not incrusted with marble, while their floors
began to be inlaid with pictorial mosaic. But we have little or nothing
of this date to show. It should, however, be noted that the graphic
taste of the Romans together with their habit of treating art as mere
decoration was now leading to a new phase of pictorial sculpture which
will have important effects<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_159" id="page_159">{159}</a></span> in the bas-relief work of the Augustan
period. In revenge Italy was now turning out a system of plastic
decoration for vases in the Aretine pottery<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> which was new and full
of possibilities.</p>

<p>On the whole the verdict must go against Rome&mdash;at any rate republican
Rome&mdash;as regards artistic originality. The Rome of Cicero’s day was
amazingly rich and dreadfully poor. It had a high culture in some
respects, but it was too corrupt, morally and politically, to produce
good work of its own. If there had been any possible rival in the field,
Rome would assuredly have perished in the course of that distracted
century. If she had perished then, what would she have left to the
world? A few second-hand comedies, Lucretius, Catullus, and Cicero; a
small equivalent for all the blood that she had shed, and all the groans
of her provincials.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_160" id="page_160">{160}</a></span></p>

is often called the “Messianic Eclogue.” It is a strange poem. In the
midst of a book of pastoral eclogues very closely modelled on the Idylls
of Theocritus, the young poet from Mantua inserts one in which he
invites the Sicilian Muses, that is, the Muses of Theocritus, to assist
him in a loftier strain than usual. His poem is a vision, a prophecy of
a return of the golden age to accompany the birth of a child. It is not
easy to determine what child. The poem was written for the consulship of
Pollio, who had helped Vergil to recover his paternal farm. Thus it is
very probable that the poem was really a piece of very gross flattery
directed to a patron. Nevertheless the prophecies of peace on earth
which it foreshadows chime so strangely with the Messianic language of
Isaiah that the scholars of the Middle Ages alternatively placed Vergil
among the prophets or condemned him as a wizard. But apart from that
approaching event to be witnessed in an obscure village of the
client-princedom of Judæa there was even in secular<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_161" id="page_161">{161}</a></span> history a general
expectation of better days to come. The Virgin Justice did in sober fact
return to the Roman world when Octavian, in 29 <small>B.C.</small>, came home to
celebrate his triumph over the three continents.</p>

<p>I make high claims for Octavian<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>&mdash;or as he may now be called by
anticipation “Augustus”&mdash;in history. Julius Cæsar has usurped the credit
of inventing that wonderful system the Roman Empire. The credit really
belongs to Augustus. Monarchy, indeed, had for two generations at the
least become inevitable at Rome, as everybody, from Catiline to Cicero,
was bound to admit. In the scramble to realise it Julius Cæsar had won
the day and had thereupon proceeded to introduce his conception of its
proper form. He died before his plans were perfected and we have no
means of knowing his inner purpose. But we know that he had spurned the
dignity of the senate, had taken some of the paraphernalia of royalty
and set up his statue alongside of the old kings of Rome. His plan of a
naked despotism had failed, because he had not reckoned with the
tyrannicide sentiment of the Roman nobles. His assassination was no mere
episode or accident. It was impossible to live like an oriental despot
in the republican city without an oriental bodyguard. Julius Cæsar had
failed through pride. When he fell, the whole dreary round of
proscriptions, triumvirate, and civil wars had to begin again. The
inevitable monarchy had to be devised afresh on a different basis: that
was the task of Augustus. He devised it in such a manner that it lasted
in the West for just five centuries and in the East for nearly fifteen.
Indeed it can hardly be said to be totally extinct now in the twentieth.
Judged by results then, the work of Augustus was clearly a consummate
piece of statesmanship. When we consider the methods by which that
result was obtained we shall, I think, esteem Augustus as the greatest
statesman in the history of the world.</p>

<p>Augustus has never been a popular hero. The pure statesman who has no
dashing feats of arms to his credit, and who<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_162" id="page_162">{162}</a></span> has left us no records of
impassioned eloquence, does not lend himself to idealisation. Augustus
had no contemporary biographer, nor even any very great historian
ancient or modern. The early Empire is in the gap between the end of
Mommsen and the beginning of Gibbon. Dr. Gardthausen has collected all
the available material about Augustus but has scarcely succeeded in
making him clear or real to us as a man. Tacitus touched him off in a
few satirical epigrams as the crafty tyrant who “bribed the army with
gifts, the populace with cheap corn, and the world with the blessings of
peace, and so grew greater by degrees while he concentrated in his own
hands the functions of the senate, the magistrates, and the laws.” For
biographical particulars we have to go to Suetonius’s <i>Lives of the
Twelve Cæsars</i>, a most unsatisfactory source. Suetonius’s pages teem
with human interest, but for purposes of history they are provoking and
baffling. He is a patient bookworm who compiles systematic little
biographies without a glimmer of the biographical sense. As imperial
librarian he had access to most valuable sources of information but he
had no critical instinct in using them. He simply collected scraps from
various sources and grouped them under headings. For a list of virtues
he would go to a courtier’s panegyrics and then turn to a seditious
pamphlet for a catalogue of vices. His own instinctive preference being
for scandal, he has touched nothing which he has not defiled. It is
chiefly due to Suetonius that Augustus appears as a selfish hypocrite,
Tiberius as a libidinous tyrant, Gaius as a maniac, Claudius as a
pedantic clown, and Nero as a monster of wickedness. And yet under these
five reigns the Empire was growing steadily in peace and prosperity. The
rulers who were omnipotent cannot have been altogether such as they are
described. The factious senators who still dreamed of unreal republican
glories and still treasured the memories of Cato as a saint and Brutus
as a martyr were not, of course, allowed free criticism of their
monarchs. They revenged themselves by writing secret libels, many but
not all of which logic and common sense can easily<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_163" id="page_163">{163}</a></span> disprove. When it
came to popular reigns like those of Vespasian or Hadrian the censorship
of the press was removed for a time, and then the senatorial Republicans
like Tacitus and Juvenal took ample revenge upon the dead. The
scurrilous pamphlets were unearthed and exalted into historical
documents and so passed down to our historians as history. It is a
suspicious and thankless task to attempt the rehabilitation of these
emperors. The world is rightly sceptical of the process which it calls
“whitewashing.” Moreover the necessary data are wanting. We can only
allow our imaginations to suggest how different the story would look if
it had been told from a sympathetic point of view.</p>

THE ARENA, NISMES</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is very difficult to form any complete idea of the character of
Augustus as a man. He had shown daring and ambition when as an obscure
lad he had crossed to Italy in 44 <small>B.C.</small> to take up his perilous
inheritance as Cæsar’s heir. He had been cool and diplomatic even in
those earliest days in the way he intrigued with the senate against
Antony, and then with Antony and Lepidus against the senate. He had had
extraordinary luck when both the consuls died in the engagements round
Modena, and left him, the prætor, in charge of a great army. Then we
have the infamous acts of the triumvirate, when the unfortunate senators
and knights were proscribed in hundreds, and Cicero, with whom the young
Cæsar had been on intimate terms, was handed over without apparent
compunction to Antony’s vengeance. Admirers said that in this he was
overborne by his older colleague, and yielded reluctantly to a stern
necessity for destroying the tyrannicide party. Enemies declared that
even if he had been reluctant to begin the bloodshed he was the most
cruel of persecutors when it started. In the fourteen years of civil war
that followed, he had succeeded in winning his way through to victory
more by coolness and luck than by any display of generalship. I do not
think that we can fairly accuse him of cowardice. It was a bold act when
he rode alone and unarmed into the camp of the rebellious and hostile
Lepidus, and took his legions away<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_164" id="page_164">{164}</a></span> from him without a blow. He had not
the dashing gallantry of Antony, or the fiery vigour of Julius, but he
must have had the gift of nerve and coolness. He had certainly come
through the most terrible difficulties and dangers from open enemies and
rebellious armies by land and sea. In the last duel with Antony luck had
been with him once more. Like the rake and gambler that he was, Antony
had thrown away his game for the sake of Eastern ambitions and Eastern
dalliance. Then there was that last scene of Cleopatra’s tragedy, when
the conqueror came to her palace after Antony had committed suicide. She
tried to win him by the same arts that had won his “father” and his
rival. Dressed in her finest robes she came weeping to him, and
displayed the picture and the letters of Julius wet with her tears. He
judged her splendour coldly as a future ornament for his triumph at
Rome, and when she disappointed him of that by a suicide staged as all
her life had been for theatrical effect, he hunted down her two elder
children with the same cold ferocity as before. Policy forbade them to
survive. That was all he thought of.</p>

<p>And now at the age of thirty-four, with this record behind him, he had
come back to Rome to celebrate his many triumphs. No doubt the few
remaining nobles at Rome trembled at his coming. Remembering the
proscriptions some of them might well tremble, especially those who had
sided with his enemies, with Sextus Pompeius, or with L. Antonius, or
with Marcus. On the other hand, some might remember the clemency which
Julius Cæsar had displayed in his hour of triumph.</p>

<p>Augustus had to restore confidence and order in a shattered world. He
had to deal with provinces ruined and desolate, a form of government
quite visibly obsolete, an aristocracy with immense traditions of pride
and power now thoroughly corrupt and effete, a Roman mob which still
called itself lord of the world, but which was in a political sense
hopeless, armies which were dangerous to the state, conscious of their
power
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_165" id="page_165">{165}</a></span>
and destitute of real patriotism. He had at his side a trusty general in
Agrippa,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> who had won many battles for him, though that in itself was
generally a dangerous circumstance, and an astute diplomat in Mæcenas,
who for the past ten years had been governing Rome in Cæsar’s name
without holding any clear official position. But beyond these two it was
hard to know where to turn for support. The civil wars and proscriptions
had almost destroyed the race of Brutus, but all that was left of the
aristocracy was still jealous and hostile under a cover of abject
sycophancy, ready to stab him with their tongues if they had not the
courage to use the stiletto. Nevertheless, Augustus had one great asset.
The Roman world, exhausted with a whole generation’s civil war, was
longing for repose. It was ready to fall down and worship the man who
would give it that. Thus the broad outlines of his policy were clear
before him. He must undertake a work of healing. The fall of Julius
warned him that he must not be openly a monarch, but the failure of
Sulla and the actual state of Rome were equally eloquent to prove that
he must retain the power in his own hands. In the lassitude following
upon grave illness&mdash;for the dangers and exposure of the civil wars had
shattered his health&mdash;he may have cherished occasional thoughts of a
real abdication. But in his brain he must have known that it was
impossible. It was, of course, equally impossible for him to govern the
whole world directly without help. For that purpose the machinery of the
whole constitution with its senate and magistracies had to be preserved,
at any rate for the present. These were the broad lines upon which his
policy was shaped.</p>

<p>The splendour of Cæsar’s triumph must have confirmed the Romans’
impression that they had now a king. For three days they saw a constant
procession of prisoners, emblems of captured cities and conquered
princes. Some of Cleopatra’s surviving children were among his train.
The three days were apportioned to the three continents, the first for
the Illyrian war of 34, the second for Actium, and the third for<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_166" id="page_166">{166}</a></span> Egypt.
Cartloads of money from the Egyptian treasury rolled up the streets, and
the bank rate at Rome fell instantly from eleven to four. There was one
significant change. In old republican days the victor had been led into
the city by his colleague and the senators, now they followed humbly in
the rear. Lavish triumphal gifts were distributed: about £11 to every
soldier, and about £4 to every citizen. Even the boys got a present in
the name of Cæsar’s dear young nephew Marcellus. Thus Cæsar passed in
his gold-embroidered purple toga, with a laurel branch in his hand,
while a slave stood behind holding a golden crown of victory over his
head. Of the horses that drew the chariot one was mounted by the
fourteen-year-old Marcellus, famous for his early death, and for
Vergil’s beautiful lines about him, and the other by his still younger
stepson, Tiberius. Thus he was drawn up to the Capitol to deposit his
laurels and his costly offerings at the feet of Jupiter.</p>

<p>There were festivities on many a day to follow. Temples were dedicated,
one to the deified Julius and one to Venus, the goddess mother of the
Julian house. There were games in which the foreign captives fought to
the death. On another day the boys of the nobility fought a Battle of
Troy in the circus. On another there was a great beast-hunt of strange
animals from Egypt when the rhinoceros and hippopotamus made their first
appearance in Europe. And then for the first time for nearly two hundred
years, that is, for the first time since the Punic Wars, the temple of
the war-god Janus was solemnly closed. <i>L’Empire c’est la paix.</i> There
are many signs of the earnest longing for Peace in the Roman world.
“Pax” and “Irene” became common names in the West and East; “Pax” was
the legend on coins. This was a new thing at Rome. Hitherto war had been
the desired as well as the normal condition. But even the Romans had now
drunk their fill of bloodshed in those dreary civil wars. It was upon
this new condition of things that Augustus had the wisdom to build his
monarchy. The army was greatly reduced at once. Fortu<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_167" id="page_167">{167}</a></span>nately the
treasury of Egypt enabled them to be dismissed without dissatisfaction.
The foreign hirelings who had served as a bodyguard were replaced by
native soldiers. A change in the <i>imperator’s</i> form of address to his
troops indicated that they were now subject to the civil rule of a
constitutional state: henceforth they were not “fellow-soldiers” but
“soldiers.”</p>

</div>

<p>And now the work of reconstruction began in earnest. Acting merely as
one of the two consuls and in obedience to a law passed through the
senate and comitia, Augustus restored the depleted ranks of the
patrician order. It is true that the patricians had no political
privileges but they still had great significance in the domain of
religion and their restoration as the first official act of the new
regime marked a deliberate desire to conciliate the aristocracy and
enlist its services in support of order. Then a census of the Roman
citizens was taken for the first time in forty years. The number found
was 4,063,000 heads, which was to be increased by 170,000 in the next
twenty years. The census and purification of the people was accompanied
by a revision of the senate-roll. Here Augustus already showed his
intention to break away from the policy of Julius. Whereas Julius had
aroused the most bitter resentment by introducing provincials and common
soldiers into the ranks of the senate, and Antony also had secured the
appointment of all sorts of disreputable friends of his own, Augustus
with infinite caution and tact reduced, strengthened, and purified the
roll. Then since the numbers had been reduced and it was necessary to
secure a respectable quorum for the transaction of business, the senate
was induced to pass a standing order that its members must not go abroad
even to the provinces without permission of its president. As Cæsar was
the president it meant a concentration of all the possible leaders of
opposition at Rome and under his eyes. During this same year, 28 <small>B.C.</small>,
the other side of Augustan rule came into prominence, the splendid
liberality which turned Rome from a decaying and ruinous city of brick
into a city of marble and made this epoch to stand out next to that of
Pericles as<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_168" id="page_168">{168}</a></span> an age of brilliant culture. No fewer than eighty-two
temples were built or restored in that year. Among the rest a
magnificent marble temple to Apollo with a public library annexed to it
was erected on the Palatine. Libraries were new and significant things
at Rome. The first had been built by Vergil’s patron Asinius Pollio only
nine years earlier.</p>

<p>The time was now ripe for the all-important settlement of the
constitution which historians have agreed to call the establishment of
the Empire. It is important to narrate the actual proceedings, at this
point, somewhat more minutely than the scope of this work generally
allows. The establishment of the Empire was such a delicate and
equivocal act that it has been open to various interpretations ever
since. Probably in the clever brain of Augustus it was intended to be
equivocal from the first, so that republican aristocrats at Rome might
still believe themselves to be free, while the populace had a prince to
whom they might look for their patron, and the provincials, particularly
those of the orient, might have a splendid monarch for their instincts
of adulation.</p>

<p>Towards the close of the year 28 Augustus had issued a proclamation
formally reversing all the illegal acts of himself and his colleagues
during the Triumvirate. It would not call the dead back to life, it
would not restore Cicero to the senate, it did not even give back the
land to the burghers of those eighteen confiscated townships. But it
marked contrition, and restitution of some sort was to follow. At the
beginning of his seventh consulship on January 13, 27 <small>B.C.</small>, Cæsar
convened a meeting of the senate and made them a long speech in which he
spoke with pride of his own and his “deified father’s” benefactions to
the state. At the end, with a true Italian instinct for the theatre he
turned to the astonished fathers and exclaimed: “And now I give back the
Republic into your keeping. The laws, the troops, the treasury, the
provinces are all restored to you. May you guard them worthily.” Dio
Cassius, who has given us a long speech certainly of his own
composition, paints the mingled feelings of the audience, the</p>

<p class="nind">indifference of those who were in the secret, the uneasiness of those
who feared that it was another trap to catch the unwary and the joy of
those who believed and hoped. The immediate reply of the senate was, it
appears, to grant him further honours&mdash;the “civic crown” of oak leaves
awarded to one who had saved the life of a fellow-citizen, in token that
Augustus had saved the lives of all his countrymen, and laurel-trees to
be planted at his gate in sign of perpetual victory.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> Then they
conducted a long and solemn debate upon the proper <i>cognomen</i> to be
conferred upon their saviour and at length decided upon the name
“Augustus.” In these proceedings we have the measure of the Augustan
senate. Already they had the instinct of courtiers. Augustus knew it,
and therefore knew what he was about in this dramatic “restoration of
the Republic.” Coins of the period bear the legend “Respublica
restituta,” and Ovid, though a courtier, was free to say</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">redditaque est omnis populo prouincia nostro<br /></span>
<span class="i4">et tuus Augusto nomine dictus auus.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">Augustus himself records this occurrence in the great inscription, in
which he afterwards described his achievements: “In my sixth and seventh
consulship, when by universal consent I had acquired complete dominion
over everything both by land and sea, I restored the State from my own
control into the hands of the Senate and People.”</p>

<p>A few sessions later, but still in the beginning of the year 27, the
senate decided upon its real answer, no doubt concocted at the
suggestion of Augustus. The senate accepted the restitution of most of
the provinces, and undertook to govern them for the future by means of
senatorial magistrates very much as they had been governed of old. But
three provinces which were still unsettled, and required soldiers, and
money, and a general, called for special treatment. Cæsar was therefore
entreated to take for his province Syria, Gaul, and Spain. Gaul was not
yet completely organised; besides Julius had<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_170" id="page_170">{170}</a></span> publicly imposed the task
of adding Britain to it upon his successor. Syria was of the utmost
importance, because the Parthians were still “riding unavenged” flushed
with fresh victories over Antony. This was another of the legacies of
Julius. Spain was still largely unconquered and in great disorder. I
think, in opposition to Ferrero, that military needs were more powerful
than economic motives in the selection of these provinces. It is to be
noted that there was no question of the restitution of Egypt. Cæsar had
never completely given this kingdom to the state. He still kept it for
the sake of its treasures, as a private domain, and governed it through
an agent, a mere knight, not even a senator. Over these three great
provinces Augustus received consular authority&mdash;much as Pompeius had
received it for the war against the pirates&mdash;for ten years. But at the
same time he promised to restore these provinces also, as soon as they
should be completely pacified. The ingenious nature of the whole
compromise will be manifest when it is perceived that this arrangement
of provinces left the senate with scarcely a single legion under its
command, while the bulk of the Roman army was concentrated in Cæsar’s
provinces.</p>

<p>Now let us consider the constitutional position of Augustus in these
years from 27 to 23, when a slight rearrangement was effected. Augustus
continued each year to be elected consul with a colleague for one year,
until he had far outstripped even the record of Marius. In addition to
this he had “consular power” over his enormous province, which included
all the armies of the state. That power was ostensibly granted for ten
years, but as a matter of fact it was renewed with some ceremony at
intervals of ten or five years throughout the reign. Constitutionally he
was by no means master of the world although, of course, he was so in
reality. He says himself: “I excelled all in prestige, but of authority
I had no more than my colleagues in each office.” For the maintenance of
his domestic dignity, he had in addition to the consulship various
privileges of tribunician authority. His person was<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_171" id="page_171">{171}</a></span> protected by the
sanctity of that office, and it is probable that all prosecutions for
treason were taken on that point. He was also chief priest. He was also
president of the senate, <i>princeps senatus</i>, but that simply meant that
his name came first on the roll, so that he had the right to speak
first. Only when Cæsar said “aye” it would be a bold man who would say
“no.”</p>

<p>For the lawyer this exhausts his titles to power, but in reality he was
something very much more than consul with tribunician powers. The one
word that embraces all his authority, constitutional and real alike, is
the word “princeps.” “Princeps” is not the title of any office, it
merely expresses dignity. He is “the chief,” he is “Cæsar the August,
the son of the God Julius, ten times hailed as general.” It is
historically misleading to speak of these early <i>principes</i> as
“Emperors,” for that word implies notions of purple and crowns really
foreign to their position. Any stout republican who chose to be deceived
could still boast that he was governed by senate and comitia, by
consuls, prætors, ædiles, tribunes, and the rest of them. It is even
historically false to believe that the senate and magistrates had ceased
to exist for practical purposes. They had, as we shall presently see, a
very real function in the state, especially when Cæsar was abroad, as in
the earlier years of his rule he constantly was. It was impossible for
one man to govern the whole empire. Little by little when a complete
imperial bureaucracy was evolved, the senate really sank into
insignificance, but for the present Cæsar and the senate were to some
extent colleagues in the government of the empire.</p>

<p>It is equally unhistorical to assert, as does the foremost of living
historians in Germany, Dr. Eduard Meyer, that this “Restoration” was a
genuine abdication, and that Cæsar only continued to act as the senate’s
executive officer. Sometimes he did act in that capacity, often he made
a pretence of so acting. Especially when there was anything disagreeable
to be done, he liked to get it authorised by a decree of the senate. But
no intelligent Roman can have failed to perceive that there was no real
equilibrium between Cæsar and Senate. Cæsar<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_172" id="page_172">{172}</a></span> had not only the control of
nearly all the legions; but at the very gate of Rome he had the only
troops in Italy, the prætorian guard, at his beck and call. Roman
generals had always had their life-guards. The law forbade the presence
of an army at Rome, but Cæsar had shown his usual ingenuity in
circumventing the spirit of the law, while respecting its letter. An
army meant a legion, and a legion consisted of ten cohorts generally of
three hundred men each. Very well, Cæsar would only have nine cohorts.
But as each consisted of a thousand men, he found himself in command of
a force equal to three legions in permanent quarters at the gates of
Rome. If he thus had the men, he had the money too. The senatorial
provinces were now, thanks to a long regime of senatorial governors,
mostly the poor ones. Cæsar had the enormous treasury of Egypt in his
pocket, Spain was rich in undeveloped mines, and Gaul had great
possibilities as yet unexploited. Moreover, Augustus had inherited an
immense patrimony from Julius, and the legacies of admiring friends also
increased his wealth. Thus it came about that the senatorial treasury
simply could not exist without help from the imperial purse. His private
wealth, too, enabled him to keep the Roman mob happy with cheap or free
corn, public shows, and handsome buildings, and to satisfy the troops
with lavish bounties. There was no real equilibrium.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Augustus was very careful not to wound republican
sensibilities. He was himself of a distinctly historical and antiquarian
turn of mind. He never performed a function or assumed an office without
assuring himself that it was not new to the constitution. Thus when he
was asked to undertake censorial duties he declined the “censorial
authority,” which the senate conferred upon him, but carried out the
duties by virtue of his power as consul, having assured himself that in
the olden times consuls had performed the duties of the censor. He was
also most punctilious in his use of forms. We shall see later something
of the republican simplicity of his mode of life. He never failed, as
his “divine father<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_173" id="page_173">{173}</a></span>” Julius had done, to treat the senate with outward
marks of respect. Call him a “crafty tyrant” if you will. It is much
more just to call him a diplomatic reformer engaged in a necessary work
of repair, working it with infinite patience, tact, and subtlety, by the
most ingenious system of compromises known to history.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plate</span> XXXV.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>In the year 23 <small>B.C.</small> there was a slight and not very important
readjustment of the constitutional situation. After his return from a
troublesome war in Spain, and after a very serious illness which had
brought him to the brink of death, he formally abdicated the consulship,
alleging his ill-health as the motive. It was, indeed, more than a
pretence. The continual tenure of the consulship involved a continual
series of ceremonial duties, which added to the immense burdens of his
position. But there were political motives as well. He was now in his
eleventh consulship, and for a nation of antiquarians it was distinctly
unpleasant that any man should compile a list of this magnitude.
Moreover, the consul had to have an apparently equal colleague, and
there was no longer at Rome an unlimited supply of nobles fit to be
Cæsar’s colleagues. Besides, it blocked the road to honour, it was
difficult to find men of consular rank for the consular provinces. More
than all, it was unnecessary. Therefore in order that he might not be
molested with reproaches, he retired to his Alban Villa, and sent a
letter to the senate not only renouncing the consulship, but suggesting
as his successor a notorious republican, who had fought for Brutus
against him, and still honoured the memory of Brutus as a martyr in the
cause of liberty.</p>

<p>That this was another solemn farce, or rather another deep stroke of
statecraft, is quite clear. The senate replied by offering him the very
powers he needed to maintain his real position unimpaired. The consular
power over the provinces was continued without any new enactment as
“proconsular.” He received certain additional powers inherent in the
tribunate, and henceforth dates his years of rule not by consulships,
but years of tribunician power. His imperium over the provinces<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_174" id="page_174">{174}</a></span> was
defined as “superior” to that of other magistrates, and he received the
special right which belonged to the consuls of proposing a motion at any
meeting of the senate. Practically, then, he was relieved of some
tiresome duties, his position was made to look more republican, and at
the same time he had increased rather than diminished his authority.</p>

<p>By this time the principate had taken its permanent form. Its powers
vary considerably with the varying force of the individual emperors, and
it tends by mere prescription as well as by the development of an
administrative hierarchy of officials to grow more absolute as the years
advance. But constitutionally very little change was made in the course
of the next three centuries. It always remained a compromise, and
something of illegitimacy always clung to it. From time to time the
senate actually remembered that it was a governing council. It had
always to be reckoned with. As for the comitia of the Populus Romanus,
they continued to exist both for legislation and elections as long as
Augustus was alive. But in reality the princeps had taken the place of
the people in the government of Rome. Tiberius, the next successor of
Augustus, suppressed the comitia as unnecessary, and though once or
twice in later times an antiquarian emperor might get a plebiscite
passed for the sake of old times, the Populus Romanus was extinct. It
perished without a groan.</p>

THE “TELLUS” GROUP; ARA PACIS</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The personality of a monarch had been thrust almost surreptitiously into
the frame of a republican constitution. Skilfully as it had been done,
the illegitimacy of the proceedings entailed certain awkward
consequences. There could be no open talk of a succession. Thus when
Augustus recovered from his grave illness in 23 <small>B.C.</small> he offered to read
his will to the senate to prove that he had nominated no successor. On
the contrary, he had formally handed to Piso, the other consul, a
written statement of the disposition of the forces and the moneys in the
treasury. That was true enough, but he had handed his signet ring, the
ring by virtue of which Mæcenas had governed Rome for ten years, to
Agrippa, the man who<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_175" id="page_175">{175}</a></span> would certainly have taken his place if he had
died at that time. In reality there is little doubt that in his own mind
Augustus had planned to make young Marcellus, the brilliant child of his
beloved sister Octavia, his heir and successor. That this ultimate
intention was plain to Agrippa when Cæsar recovered is shown by
Agrippa’s sulky retirement into private life. Although Augustus could
not directly or legally nominate a successor, he could train a young
prince for the succession, and in his own lifetime raise him to such a
point of honour that he would naturally step into the vacant place. The
newly born Empire had the great good fortune that Augustus, in spite of
his feeble health, lived to a ripe age and held the principate for
forty-one years. But it had the misfortune to be governed by a sterile
race. Not for a hundred years until Titus, did a son succeed his father.
Augustus had nephews, stepchildren, and grandchildren, but he had only
one child by his three wives, and she was the immoral Julia. All his
life long he was vexed with tiresome dynastic problems, and each youth
whom he selected for his successor seemed to be destined to a premature
death. At the last he was driven sorely against his will to nominate his
stepson Tiberius. This fact is mentioned here because it is surely a
vital fact in determining the future of the principate. If each of the
first half-dozen holders of that office had been surrounded by a
blooming family on the scale of modern royalty, it is very likely that
the principate would have settled down quietly into a hereditary
monarchy. As it was, the whole system was upset by continual intrigues
for the succession, often leading to actual civil warfare. Thus the army
and the prætorian guard came to acquire its fatal domination over Roman
politics.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Senate</span></h3>

<p>For all his moderation Augustus had successfully gathered all the
strings of policy into his own hands. In his three revisions of the
senate-list he succeeded in securing a body absolutely subservient to
his wishes, and the only trouble it<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_176" id="page_176">{176}</a></span> caused him was by its excess of
zeal for his dignity. As a rule it merely registered his decrees,
conferred honours on the kinsmen he delighted to honour, and sometimes
shouldered the responsibility for an unpopular proposal. It was to some
extent a safety-valve for the expression of public opinion, but the more
tyrannical emperors (and Augustus undoubtedly became more absolute as
his system developed) kept a very tight hand upon it. When an embassy
came from an independent foreign power, such as Parthia, it went first
to a powerful senator, just as in republican days to seek a <i>patronus</i>
or champion. Now that champion was, of course, none other than the
princeps. By him the ambassadors were introduced to the senate, who
heard their case and deliberated upon it. As of old, they would
necessarily entrust the settlement of the matter to a commissioner
chosen from their own body. Again, the commissioner was of course the
princeps. The senate sometimes undertook state impeachments as a high
court of justice, but now it was only Cæsar’s enemies whom they
impeached, and in one case&mdash;that of the prefect of Egypt&mdash;they displayed
an excess of zeal in Cæsar’s cause which brought down a rebuke upon
their heads. The senate was used often as a medium of publication. Cæsar
would go down to the house and read a speech to them when he intended to
reach a wider public. When he was abroad, he would send regular reports
and despatches to them. Cæsar, like all Roman magistrates, had his
consilium or board of advisers. This was now organised to consist of so
many representative senators, who sat in conjunction with the young
princes of the imperial house, and any other important people whom Cæsar
might select for his privy council. Towards the end, when Augustus grew
old and infirm, a committee of senators sitting in the palace was
competent to transact business. But as a rule he was very careful to
respect the senatorial traditions. Decrees of the senate and laws were
passed with all the old formalities, but now they were all in reality
Cæsar’s laws and Cæsar’s decrees. On the whole, however, we may well
believe that the senat<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_177" id="page_177">{177}</a></span>e’s decline into impotence was largely its own
fault. So far as the records show, the Augustan senate never displayed
the least trace of spirit or, if that is too much to expect, even of
initiative or efficiency. There was grumbling and a little feeble
plotting, but if the senate had chosen to take Augustus at his word
whenever he spoke of abdication, they might easily have recovered real
power, though indeed they could not have done without a princeps. For
one thing the mob would not have suffered it. Cæsar was, and remained,
the patron of the inarticulate commons, and that was not only the origin
of the principate but the main support of its power throughout. When we
speak of unpopular emperors such as Nero or Domitian we generally mean
only that they were unpopular with the notables of the senate. If they
failed to retain the regard of the common people and the common soldiers
their reigns speedily came to an end. Cæsar’s pretended abdication in 23
<small>B.C.</small> was shortly afterwards followed by a famine at Rome and the
populace besieged the senate-house, threatening it with fire unless
fresh powers were conferred upon their champion.</p>

RELIEF, FROM THE “ARA PACIS”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>German historians have invented the term Dyarchy to describe the balance
of power between Cæsar and senate. The government of Rome had always
been to some extent a Dyarchy of senate and people as its title
shows&mdash;“Senatus Populusque Romanus.” In many respects the princeps had
taken the place of the people. But such a description loses sight of
reality. You cannot in this whole period show an army set in motion by a
senatorial governor without authority from Augustus, save in the single
case of M. Primus when it was instantly followed by a prosecution; nor a
single tax imposed, nor a law so much as proposed without Cæsar’s
authority, nor a candidate elected without his concurrence, nor a treaty
made otherwise than in accordance with his suggestion. The true relation
between them is practically that of a monarch and his council. Three
times Cæsar revised the roll of the senate, reducing it from over one
thousand members to six hundred, and for all his tact and ingenuity
arousing the fiercest resentment. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_178" id="page_178">{178}</a></span> were violent scenes in the
house, Augustus wore a shirt of mail, and went accompanied by ten
stalwart senators. It is clear that he was purging the house of his
opponents just as Cromwell did. On other occasions he would present his
friends with the amount of property needed to complete their
qualification for the senate. Thus it is no exaggeration to call the
senate his council of state. If it is objected that the senate still
governed rich and important provinces, that is more apparent than true.
No longer did the governor of a senatorial province go out girt with the
sword that signifies <i>imperium</i> or wearing the military cloak. Now he
goes in his toga as a mere civilian functionary. That little change must
have been bitterly galling to the proud aristocracy. Augustus had
persuaded them to pass an ordinance forbidding them to go abroad without
his permission. He made them fine their members for non-attendence, and
it is highly significant that it was difficult to keep a quorum of the
senate for public business. He chose his own order for asking their
opinions and thus promoted them in honour or degraded them as he
pleased. It was mainly the poor and unimportant provinces which had
fallen to their share. Asia was the richest and most important, but
almost throughout the period there is some scion of the imperial house
with a general control over the affairs of the East. There is an
inscription in Cyprus which proves that even when that island was under
senatorial government a proconsul was sent out “by the authority of
Cæsar and a decree of the senate” to restore order. Finally by the end
of the reign the senate had become so feeble and unreal that twenty of
its members sitting in Cæsar’s house were able to pass decrees which had
the full validity of the old sovereign council of Rome.</p>

SILVER PLATE FROM BOSCOREALE</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>These considerations are enough to prove that Monarchy is the only term
which can properly describe the real nature of the new government.
Nevertheless, here as elsewhere in this system of compromise and
half-way houses, we must walk warily between two fallacies. The senate
is there and will<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_179" id="page_179">{179}</a></span> always be there. When Constantine made a new Rome he
made a new senate. As we study the subsequent progress of the Empire we
shall sometimes find the senate really supreme. It chose Galba and
Nerva. It dared to depose Maximin. It really governed through Tacitus
and Probus. It was its constant aim to get its members declared immune
from prosecution and sometimes it succeeded; but more often it served as
a whipping-stock when Cæsar was in a bad temper. Only in this sense is
there any meaning in the term Dyarchy: if we take the whole period of
the principate from Augustus to Diocletian there is some trace of
equilibrium, faint though it be. And we must not fall into the error of
despising the letter of a constitution for the sake of its spirit.
Though a king of England never refuses a bill in practice, it
nevertheless remains important that he may. The letter is always there
for reference, if not for use, and the spirit is always liable to be
brought up for trial before it. The practice depends upon personal
forces which are transitory, the theory is always there awaiting its
opportunity.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The People and the Magistrates</span></h3>

<p>Nevertheless, if it is to the letter of the constitution that one
appeals, we must not forget the existence of a third element in the
constitution of Augustus&mdash;the People. As we have seen, the plebiscite
and the lex still passed formally through the comitia. The plebiscite
had of late republican years become a weapon of opposition to the
senate. Yet even under Augustus we can point to a few measures passed in
this form. None were of much importance&mdash;one was merely the conferring
of the new title of “Father of his Country” upon Cæsar. Another
concerned aqueducts. The judicial functions of the populus were entirely
abrogated by Augustus, and there only remained that which, after all,
had always been its most important function, the elections. Popular
election in the comitia was still under Augustus, the only path to the
senate and the magistracies. It is true that the magistracies had all
paled<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_180" id="page_180">{180}</a></span> into insignificance before the new and mighty office of the
princeps. For this reason, perhaps, Augustus did not deprive them of
what they regarded not only as an ancient right, but still more as a
source of income. Here also there might have been effective opposition.
The populus might have returned to office, and so to the senate, a
series of champions of freedom. But except Egnatius Rufus, there were no
such champions. The patron of the people, the man whose munificence fed
them and gave them the shows they lived for, was Cæsar. No one could
bribe against his purse. He had, moreover, two direct methods of
securing the return of his nominees. In virtue of his tribunician powers
he had the right to draw up the list of candidates, and in the second
place it had always been the practice for candidates to put forward the
names of their principal supporters. Augustus in his early days of
strict deference to constitutional etiquette used to go down to the
forum and personally canvass for his friends, afterwards, however, he
reverted to the brusquer methods of Julius, and merely issued a
fly-sheet to the electors bearing the names of his nominees. Thus the
elections became more and more a form, and Tiberius transferred them to
the senate without arousing much opposition. In the whole period of
Augustus we have only one instance of his failure to pass a law which he
desired and then it was due to the organised opposition of the knights
who demanded its rejection publicly in the theatre.</p>

<p>The equestrian order still remained the stronghold of the wealthy
bourgeoisie. Owing to their wealth and their want of political
recognition, they had always been somewhat of a danger to the republican
constitution. It is typical of the skilful statesmanship of Augustus
that he saw this and provided an honourable outlet for their ambitions
as well as utilising their services on behalf of the state. He had begun
his period of rule by putting a mere <i>eques</i> into the seat of the
Ptolemies as his prefect of Egypt. Subsequently the imperial legates and
procurators who administered the imperial provinces for him were often
chosen from this order. In finance he made great<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_181" id="page_181">{181}</a></span> use of them, and along
with a certain number of clever Greek freedmen they filled the greater
part of the new bureaucracy which he gradually created. Mæcenas himself,
who was probably at the head of the whole great system, and who acted
almost as prime minister to Augustus until he fell out of favour, was
content with equestrian rank. Social honours such as rich men love were
freely bestowed upon them. The young princes of the imperial house rode
at the head of the knights with silver lances as “Princes of the Youth.”
Sometimes Augustus treated the equestrian order as if it were a third
limb of the constitution on an equality with the senate and people.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plate</span> XXXIX.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Thus it was part of the system of Augustus to provide careers for talent
in every class. Even the slaves and freedmen had immense opportunities
in Cæsar’s bureaux. For the freedmen in the country towns, where they
were often the richest inhabitants, he invented the special titular
distinction of “Augustals,” their principal duty being to give dinners
and festivals in his honour, precisely the sort of duty to flatter their
pride without doing any harm.</p>

<p>As for the ancient magistracies of the Roman people, while they were
strictly preserved, they were utterly disarmed. Consulships remain
important only as leading to a subsequent proconsulship over a province.
The prætors still sat in their courts of justice but really important
cases came up to Cæsar on appeal. The tribunes were of no account beside
their mighty colleague. Magistracies were bestowed as marks of imperial
favour. Often there would be two or three successive consuls in a single
year. Cæsar himself would sometimes deign to take a consulship when he
wished to honour a colleague or a relative. Here again, however, the
impotence of the magistracies was very largely due to the intellectual
bankruptcy of the Roman nobility. They could not perform the simplest
task such as the charge of the corn-supply without bungling and
requiring the assistance of Cæsar. But on one occasion when a certain
ædile organised a fire-brigade of his own and became very zealous in
extinguishing fires, he received a hint that his<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_182" id="page_182">{182}</a></span> zeal was unwelcome in
the highest quarters. Thus the magistracies declined little by little
into mere decorations, or became once more what they had been in the
beginning, municipal officers for the city of Rome. But even there they
were superseded by the organising activity of the princeps. He
resuscitated the ancient office of city prefect and put him in charge of
the new police and the new fire-brigade while two other new prefects
commanded the prætorian guards. These two officers soon began to
overshadow the old magistracies.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Army and Treasury</span></h3>

<p>Dio Cassius rightly asserts that the real power of Augustus rested upon
two things&mdash;the control of the army and of the finances. We have already
seen that in the so-called abdications of Augustus there was no
surrender of these and no suggestion of their surrender. In view of the
present tendency among historians to attach real importance to the
restoration of the Republic in 27 <small>B.C.</small> and again in 23 <small>B.C.</small> it is all
the more important to remember that the twenty-three legions which with
their auxiliaries and reserves formed the entire military force of the
Roman Empire took their oath solely to Augustus and were with one
exception stationed exclusively in his provinces, fought under his
auspices and took their orders from no other but Cæsar and his legates.
Beyond these he had a prætorian corps of 9000 men in permanent
cantonments within striking distance of Rome, as well as a drilled
bodyguard of slaves in his own house. In view of these facts it is
absurd to limit our conception of the power of Cæsar to a survey of the
constitutional offices which he held. It is only in the language of
lawyers and pedants that his authority rested upon consular and
tribunician powers. Everybody knew that a letter sealed with Cæsar’s
sphinx was backed by the swords of 140,000 legionaries. The military
situation of Augustus is therefore of the utmost importance.</p>

AUGUSTUS AND FAMILY OF CÆSARS<br />
<small>CAMEO</small></p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Augustus was, as we have seen, a statesman and not a soldier. The
stories of his cowardice, repeated by Suetonius,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_183" id="page_183">{183}</a></span> are confessedly drawn
from the venomous letters of his enemy, Antony. Augustus had emerged
successfully through five civil wars, had crossed tempestuous seas in
small boats, had faced mutinous armies and every sort of hardship. But
all his instincts were for peace and statecraft. We have seen that it
was the need of a standing army at Rome which led to the need of
permanent generals, and this to the downfall of the old Roman
constitution. When Cæsar built his throne on the ruins of the Republic
the plain fact was that the general had become monarch. Thus, in spite
of the fact that Augustus was not of a military character, and in spite
of all his efforts to prevent it, the monarchy of the Roman Empire was
eventually revealed as a military despotism. It was the irony of fate
that such a man as Augustus should have founded such a monarchy.</p>

<p>But for the present the ugly fact that the army had bestowed the purple
was decently concealed. Augustus from the very beginning of his power
did his best to reduce the military element in the state. During the
civil wars, and indeed for fifty years before they began, the troops had
made and unmade consuls, there had been constant mutinies and blackmail
in the army. Cæsar’s own first consulship had been obtained in this way.
A centurion had marched into the senate-house and cried, “If you will
not make him consul, <i>this</i>”&mdash;and he tapped the hilt of his sword&mdash;“this
shall.” But now the older discipline was revived. Agrippa in particular
was a stern disciplinarian of the old school. The soldiers were
flattered no longer. No more legionary coins were issued. For an honour
a legion was allowed to call itself Augusta, for a punishment the title
was revoked. The highest military distinction, the triumph, was
gradually reserved for the princeps and the members of his house alone.
Even when the title of Imperator was earned by a victorious general it
was transferred to him. But it was his aim to see that no private
citizen should have the opportunity of securing the high military
honours. Agrippa might have been dangerous and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_184" id="page_184">{184}</a></span> accordingly he was
brought into the family by marriage with Cæsar’s daughter. But for the
rest the conduct of important operations was almost always confided to
one of the young princes&mdash;to Tiberius, or Drusus, or Germanicus. And
they were always victorious. When Quintilius Varus, a general of humbler
birth, was allowed to lead a great army he conveniently pointed the
moral by a signal failure. No senatorial governor might now levy troops
or declare war on his own account.</p>

<p>The only hand that the senate still had in military affairs was that a
“senatus consultum” was generally asked for a new levy of troops. This
was probably because it concerned the state treasury, but partly also
because it served to shift an unpleasant responsibility off the
shoulders of the princeps. It is not likely that Augustus had forgone
the right to levy.</p>

<p>It still remained the legal duty of every Roman citizen to serve in the
army. But since the days of Marius that duty had become obsolete, no one
wanted the city riff-raff in the legions. Soldiering had become a
profession, and there was never now any general levy of the kind
involved in modern conscription. There must have been some compulsion
upon the upper classes to serve as officers, for Suetonius tells of a
Roman knight who was sold into slavery because he had chopped off his
son’s thumbs in order to evade military service. There had been a “City
Legion” fighting at Actium, but the army was now mainly recruited from
Italy and the imperial provinces. Allied princes like Herod the Great
had their own militias, but were also liable to be asked for
contributions of trained auxiliaries to the imperial army. From the
provinces troops were demanded in proportion to their warlike activity.
The Dutch horsemen were famous, and the Batavians supplied large
contributions of cavalry. The only people in the East who were enrolled
in the legions were the Galatians, who were, of course, Gauls by
ancestry. Augustus himself had a bodyguard of German slaves. As a rule
only freemen were enrolled in the legions, but at the crisis of the
great Pannonian and German revolts,</p>

<p class="nind">the duty was laid upon rich citizens of equipping and maintaining for
six months a certain number of freedmen and slaves who were promised
their liberty and citizenship at the end of six months. These would
probably consist very largely of gladiators. This fact is evidence of
serious military weakness in the Roman Empire. Although there were over
four million full Roman citizens, there were only about 140,000 men in
the ranks of the legions, and as there was a very long period of
service, twenty-five years and more, it follows that only a small number
of recruits would be wanted every year. It seems a dangerously small
army to hold such vast frontiers.</p>

<p>Augustus was successful in reducing the enormous rate of pay which had
prevailed during the civil wars. After the death of Augustus the troops
mutinied and demanded an increase of their pay to a denarius (less than
a franc) a day. Augustus established a special military chest to provide
pensions for his veterans in place of the farms which they were still
accustomed to expect.</p>

<p>How greatly&mdash;how dangerously&mdash;Augustus had reduced the size of the army
may be seen from the fact that there were at least fifty legions during
the civil wars, and only twenty-five at the death of Augustus. These
troops were for the most part stationed along the northern and eastern
frontiers.</p>

<p class="nind">To these must be added the 9000 men of the prætorian guard, who enjoyed
shorter service (sixteen years) and double pay. The prætorians had to be
genuine Italians, and when inside the walls of Rome wore civilian dress.
There were also three<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_186" id="page_186">{186}</a></span> “urban cohorts” as police&mdash;a new and most
salutary invention&mdash;and a “cohort of watchmen” for the prevention of
fire. Obviously with a service of twenty-five years there could be no
reserve. But some of the veterans of the prætorian guard were used as
paymasters or engineers. There were also colonies of time-expired
soldiers planted as garrisons in dangerous country.</p>

<p>The legions themselves were stationed in great fortified camps along the
frontiers of their various provinces. There were thus huge spaces of
country totally without military forces. For warfare on the shores of
the Black Sea troops had to be summoned from Syria. There was no such
thing as a readily mobilised striking force in Italy. This was an
inconvenience and a danger, but Augustus did not mean to organise a
military monarchy. Professor Gardthausen has a clever comparison of the
problems before the Roman army with those that face the British Empire.
The problems were remarkably similar, for greater speed of transport
counteracts the greater distances. Both peoples made great use of the
system of drilling native troops and expecting provinces to guard
themselves. But the Romans would have been saved much trouble if they
had been able to adopt our system of a compact and highly trained
expeditionary force backed by a citizen army for home defence. To be
sure, the Romans now lived in a state of peace far more profound than
any that the world has enjoyed before or since. Their wars were of their
own making. Within the circle of the armed frontiers Pax Romana reigned
supreme. The Roman citizens hung up their swords for ever.</p>

<p>The creation of a standing fleet was not the least of Cæsar’s
achievements. The Mediterranean was now properly policed and commerce
was free to circulate. The Italian navy was divided into two flotillas,
one for the Western Mediterranean and one for the Adriatic. Great
artificial docks were constructed for them, one for the Mediterranean
fleet at Misenum by opening up a connection between the Avernian and
Lucrine<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_187" id="page_187">{187}</a></span> lakes and the sea and thus creating a small land-locked harbour
which was used for exercising the rowers in rough weather. The
construction of this Portus Julius, which was carried out by Agrippa
with a lofty disregard both of the gastronomic fame of the Lucrine
oysters and of the mythological celebrity of the lake of Avernus as the
gateway to the underworld, excited a wonder which has been reflected
both by Horace and Vergil.</p>

<p>Similarly a base for the Adriatic fleet was constructed by great
engineering works at Ravenna. A third harbour was created on the coast
of Gaul at Fréjus (Forum Julii). The Tiber was dredged and restored to
navigation. Flotillas of small vessels were maintained on the Rhine.</p>

<p>The navy, however, did not even in these days attain to anything like
the status of the army. It was “my fleet”&mdash;the private property of the
emperor, equipped and maintained out of his own pocket, and manned
chiefly by his slaves. Even the “prefects of the fleet” were generally
freedmen and foreigners. A Roman admiral, as Mommsen remarks, ranked
below a procurator or a tax-collecter. Thus the Romans never to the end
of their days realised the meaning or importance of sea-power. Their
navy was only for police work and on several occasions, as for example
in the Dalmatian War, they failed to perceive that naval operations
might have been of the greatest assistance to their army. It is true
that there were no hostile navies in the world, but the empire was so
distributed that marine communication might have been of very great
value.</p>

<p>The control of finance was a necessary corollary to the control of the
troops. The Republic had been shipwrecked on finance almost as much as
on the military system, and there is some truth in Mommsen’s epigram:
“the Romans had bartered their liberty for the corn-ships of Egypt.”
Perhaps the most sinister light in which we can regard the statesmanship
of Augustus is that suggested by Tacitus. He was buying the support of
all classes in the state systematically. But to that the Republic had
already accustomed them.</p>

<p>We must clear our minds of the modern idea of a budget<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_188" id="page_188">{188}</a></span> and a coherent
public system of finance. The Romans had never paid taxes and their
financial administration had rested in the hands of young men just
beginning their public career as quæstors. This was because finance was
a comparatively recent idea at Rome. It was not part of the <i>mos
maiorum</i> at Rome to have a financial policy, and Rome had always been a
military and not a commercial state. Even now it was a cheap empire. If
we except the corn-supply, the pay of the army was the only large head
of expenditure. On the whole, one with another, the provinces were more
than self-supporting, and as time went on a prudent policy of
development made them extremely profitable. As we shall see later, the
encouragement of natural resources and the exploitation of minerals all
over the Empire added enormously to the Roman wealth. Officials and
magistrates had generally been expected not only to give their services
for nothing but even to pay for their honours handsomely with public
works and entertainments. Public works undertaken by the state were
generally carried out by slaves or soldiers. When marble was needed it
was usually requisitioned from Greece or Numidia. But it was inevitable
that the man who controlled the army should also possess the revenues.
Julius Cæsar had simply appropriated the treasury. Augustus as usual
reached the same end by a more devious path.</p>

<p>The enormous treasures which he disbursed were his favourite weapons of
statecraft. If he had a friend to get into the senate he would simply
make him a present of the necessary income. To retain the goodwill of
the commons he scattered those immense largesses which he has recorded
on the Ancyran monument. To the Roman plebs he distributed over six
millions sterling in eight donations. On another occasion of financial
stress he lent more than half a million without interest. When the
soldiers had to be rewarded after Actium he was able to save himself
from the unpopular necessity of confiscation by finding six millions in
cash to buy them land. There was scarcely a town in the empire which had
not some splendid<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_189" id="page_189">{189}</a></span> building to bear witness of its debt to Cæsar’s
generosity, and we shall see how he transformed the whole aspect of the
metropolis. In addition to all this he often replenished the state
treasury out of his own pocket. Over a million and a half was thus
transferred. No wonder that a man who could thus pour his gold into the
treasury should come to regard it as his own.</p>

<p>To the Roman mind it was unbecoming to a free gentleman to be asked to
pay taxes in a free country. They held that a <i>tributum</i> was only for
slaves to pay. Moreover it was one of the limitations of the power of
Augustus that he had no constitutional right to impose taxation on
Italy. Twice indeed he proposed to inflict a property-tax on Roman
citizens. In <small>A.D.</small> 4 and 13 he took a census of all properties above
£2000 as a preliminary measure, but on the second occasion at least it
is explained by the historian as a shrewd stroke of diplomacy to make
people acquiesce in the existing death-duties. The serious financial
embarrassment of these years was caused by the expense of the gratuities
paid to time-expired soldiers. The soldier’s daily pay of about sixpence
was only pocket-money, he had always expected a farm on his discharge.
Under Augustus this allowance of land was commuted for a bounty of about
£125 for the legionary, or £185 for the prætorian guard. Of course, with
a service of over twenty years and constant fighting, the number of
veterans discharged each year must have fallen considerably below the
20,000 recruits enrolled, but still it was a heavy expense. In some
cases the veterans were retained under the colours and in some cases
land in new countries was still given. But this burden led to the
establishment of a new military chest in <small>A.D.</small> 6. This was filled in the
first instance by a donation of nearly two millions from Augustus and
Tiberius, but it was maintained by two indirect taxes which fell upon
the Roman citizens&mdash;very much to their annoyance. One was a tax of one
per cent. on all objects bought and sold, the other a five per cent. tax
on legacies. The latter was not imposed purely for revenue. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_190" id="page_190">{190}</a></span> was
intended, along with other laws, to discourage celibacy, since it only
fell upon those who died without heirs of kin. What appears to be a
distinct tax is another upon the sale of slaves.</p>

<p>The other large head of expenditure was that of the Roman corn-supply.
Two hundred thousand people received free corn and the rest of the
citizens always expected to buy it very cheaply. Most of this corn came
from Egypt and Sicily as taxation paid in kind. The control of the
supply was in the hands of a new department, <i>cura annonæ</i>, but owing to
its mismanagement there were several periods of famine, on which
occasions either Augustus himself or some member of his family had to
step in and put things straight.</p>

<p>The general expenses of administering the Empire were not as great as
modern analogies would lead us to suppose. No doubt the imperial legates
and procurators received wages out of the imperial fiscus. It is
commonly stated that all provincial magistrates now received a fixed
salary instead of being left to plunder the provincials. The truth is
that the higher magistrates of Rome never had received and did not for a
long time yet receive a salary. But they had always claimed an allowance
for their travelling expenses technically called “mule and tent money,”
and this had been fixed on a generous scale which really amounted in
practice to a salary. The only change was that instead of allowing these
fees to be subject to contract on the regular contract system of the
republican treasury, the governors now received a fixed grant calculated
according to the necessary scale of expenses in the various provinces.
For the provinces an immense saving was effected in this manner but it
must have been more expensive to the central treasury.</p>

<p>The finances of the provinces were gradually brought into order and
arranged with consummate skill. The little information that we possess
tends to show that nowhere was the Augustan reformation more beneficent
or more brilliantly successful. In Gaul the land-tax and property-tax
were fixed<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_191" id="page_191">{191}</a></span> in 26 on a fairly high scale, it is true, but the
development of commerce and agriculture fostered by the Romans made
their incidence a light burden in comparison with the rapidly increasing
wealth of the province. By this time the state had accepted the theory
of tribute which the Roman lawyers had developed upon false principles.
Tribute was now regarded, not as a commutation of the liability to
military service, which was its real origin, but as a rent paid to Rome
for the continued enjoyment of lands which had passed to her by right of
conquest. The tribute was everywhere reassessed upon a new valuation
systematically conducted. Generally it represented a tithe of the corn
harvest and 20 per cent. of liquid products, such as oil and wine. In
the senatorial provinces the old system of tax-farming by contractors
survived for a time, but in his own provinces Augustus instituted an
imperial board of revenue administered by Roman knights or Greek slaves
and freedmen as his fiscal procurators. We have, indeed, three known
cases of embezzlement by native agents. One, Eros, had advertised his
insolent rapacity in Egypt by purchasing a celebrated fighting quail for
an immense sum of money, and then cooking it for his dinner. Another,
Licinius, a native Gaul set to collect taxes in his own country,
disarmed Cæsar’s wrath like the servant in the parable by showing rooms
full of silver and gold, which he professed to have stored up in his
master’s interest. In this case it is zealous extortion which is charged
against him. One of his methods was to extort fourteen months’ taxes in
the year by pointing out to the innocent natives that since December was
by its very name the tenth month, they had two more monthly
contributions to pay before the end of the year. A paymaster, also a
slave, who died in Tiberius’s reign, was notorious for the retinue of
fourteen persons who attended him on his travels. He had his private
cooks and physicians. But these are isolated cases. On the whole it is
clear that the provinces were rejoicing at their deliverance from the
oppression of the Republic. They were always anxious to be transferred
from the senate to Cæsar. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_192" id="page_192">{192}</a></span> the tax-gatherer was still at their door,
he was now a man under independent authority with a master who would
listen to petitions and appeals. Moreover, they now had a government
which assisted them to pay by intelligently developing their resources.</p>

<p>The public treasury of the senate was no longer entrusted to mere
quæstors. Augustus at first instituted prefects for this also. But the
dearth of administrative capacity at Rome compelled him to transfer the
charge to the prætors. However, he kept an eye upon its administration
himself, as is shown by the fact that when he died he left to the state
an account of the condition of the treasury.</p>

<p>It is still too early to speak of a definite system of division between
the public “ærarium” and the emperor’s private “fiscus.” But the budget
of the senate would include:</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Provinces</span></h3>

<p>Turning now to a rapid survey of the Roman world from a geographical
point of view we shall see the work of restoration and repair,
proceeding with the same methodical thoroughness which makes this regime
one of the most beneficent in the history of civilisation. We have
already seen something of the provincial system as it was reorganised in
27 <small>B.C.</small> The provinces which fell to the share of the senate were these:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>Asia.</i></li>
<li><i>Africa.</i></li>
<li><i>Gallia Narbonensis</i> (transferred to the senate in 22 <small>B.C.</small>)</li>
<li><i>Hispania Bætica.</i></li>
<li><i>Crete</i> with the Cyrenaica.</li>
<li><i>Macedonia</i> with Achaia.</li>
<li><i>Bithynia</i> with Pontus.</li>
<li><i>Cyprus</i> (also transferred to the senate in 22 <small>B.C.</small>).</li>
<li><i>Dalmatia</i> (until the revolt of 11 <small>B.C.</small>).</li>
<li><i>Sardinia</i> with Corsica.</li>
<li><i>Sicily.</i></li>
</ul>

<p>These were governed by annual magistrates, chosen by lot from a list
selected by the senate&mdash;the first two by proconsuls of consular rank,
the others also by governors termed proconsuls but actually only of
prætorian rank, that is, ex-prætors. Africa was the only one of these
provinces which contained troops and the senatorial governors went out
in civilian dress as administrators only. Cæsar’s provinces were:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>Spain.</i></li>
<li><i>Gaul.</i></li>
<li><i>Syria</i> with Cilicia and, until 22 <small>B.C.</small>, Cyprus.</li>
</ul>

<p>To these were gradually added:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>Germania.</i></li>
<li><i>Illyricum</i>, including Dalmatia and Pannonia.</li>
<li><i>Galatia</i>, including Lycaonia, Pamphylia, Pisidia, and part of Cilicia, with Paphlagonia added in 5 <small>B.C.</small></li>
</ul>

<p>These were all governed by legates of Cæsar, commonly<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_194" id="page_194">{194}</a></span> chosen from the
ranks of the senate, with the title of proprætor. They held office for
as long as Cæsar desired, and were provided with a staff, chosen by him,
of trained financiers. In addition to these, other districts under
prefects were gradually accumulated:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>Egypt.</i></li>
<li><i>Mœsia</i> and Triballia.</li>

<p class="nind">In his own provinces Cæsar was supreme in all things; he had the right
of making peace, war, and alliance, without consulting the senate.
Though he governed through legates or procurators, the Roman law had
always granted a right of appeal from a lower magistrate to his
superior. This was the source of Paul’s “appeal unto Cæsar” from the
procurator of Judæa. In the senatorial provinces his imperium, which had
been specially defined as “superior” (<i>maius</i>), gave him precedence when
he was actually present. And we have many cases of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_195" id="page_195">{195}</a></span> interference in
senatorial provinces. Cæsar’s legates, such as Agrippa, Tiberius, and
Gaius, constantly act as overlords in Asia, though a decree of the
senate is required for this. We hear of Augustus founding colonies in
Sicily. Moreover, the princeps had sole authority over the army, and for
any military operations it would be necessary to borrow troops of him.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>The foundations of this great empire were not hastily or carelessly
laid. Although of feeble constitution and by nature a man of peace,
Augustus spent the first half of his long reign more abroad than at
home, in fighting rebels and organising or reforming with unwearied
energy. To this part of his work we are unable to devote sufficient
attention through lack of material. The ancient historians prefer to
record small victories over barbarian tribes, or the petty gossip of the
Roman streets, while they have little to say about the tireless
administration which in one generation transformed the Roman world from
a horrible chaos into that scene of peace and prosperity shown to us in
the pages of Strabo and Pliny. So while our eyes are fixed upon the sins
and follies of Roman emperors and courtiers, until we get an impression
of rotten tyranny conducted according to the caprice of monsters and
fools, all the time the greater part of Europe was advancing in peace to
a state of general culture and civilisation such as it had never known
before, and such as it never knew again until the nineteenth century. A
casual glance over the inscriptions of a provincial town probably gives
us a truer impression than all the rhetoric of the historians. In
Pompeii, for example, a small and unimportant suburb of Naples which
scarcely comes into the view of history, we see a busy and useful
municipal life carried on in absolute security. There were the ten
councillors (<i>decuriones</i>), who corresponded to the Roman senate, and
there were two local consuls bearing the title of “duumviri.” In most
cases a small municipality would have its “patronus” also, a local
squire, perhaps, who in some measure corresponded to the princeps, and
who would represent the interests of the town at Rome, or with the
Roman<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_196" id="page_196">{196}</a></span> prætor. His main business, however, was to equip his town with
baths, temples, and colonnades, or to provide it with public banquets.
For the rich freedmen, in whose hands was much of the trade of the
place, Augustus had provided the new office of <i>Seviri Augustales</i>,
which we have already described. There were no rates, for private
munificence took their place. There was no direct taxation in Italy, and
the indirect taxes were inconsiderable. Internal trade was free. The
obligation to military service was so widely distributed that it fell
very lightly on Italy, and the natives accordingly became less and less
warlike. All the Italian peoples were now Roman citizens. Trade was
greatly assisted by the improvement of communications which took place
during this period. The care of roads properly devolved upon the senate,
but as they showed their usual incompetence in this department the
princeps had to step in and organise a special Board of Roads with a
curator for each of the trunk lines of communication. Augustus also
established an imperial post with a system of stages and relays, which
lasted on until the coming of railways. The vehicles and horses were
maintained by the roadside communities, and imperial messengers who
carried a <i>diploma</i> or passport were allowed to travel express by this
means. The great road to Rimini, the Flaminian Way, was the first to be
repaired, and Augustus adorned its terminal city with a handsome marble
bridge<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> and triumphal arch, possibly as a compensation for the
trouble which he himself had inflicted upon the town during the civil
wars. Flourishing historic cities like Turin and Brescia owe their
origin to colonies founded by Augustus. Towns like Perugia which had
been almost destroyed in the civil wars now grew up again and
flourished. In all, Augustus founded twenty-eight colonies in Italy, and
supplied 90,000 veterans of the civil wars with land which he had bought
and paid for. That the sea was now safe for trade and fishery must have
meant a great deal to the coast towns. Augustus himself wrote an account
of the condition of Italy, and Pliny<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_197" id="page_197">{197}</a></span> confesses to using it as his
authority. In all the long and important history of Italy it is doubtful
whether she has ever enjoyed such peace and prosperity as began for her
in the reign of Augustus.</p>

PORCH AND INTERIOR OF THE PANTHEON, ROME</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>A broad view of foreign politics showed Augustus two vital points of
danger&mdash;the North and East. To the north the fierce and warlike
barbarians of Germany had been checked indeed by Julius, but also
exasperated. Tribes more or less akin to them extended southwards across
the Danube and even to the Austrian Tyrol, where they were little more
than a week’s march from the gates of Rome. A strong frontier policy was
needed here. In the East there were the Parthians, the only possible
rival power to Rome. The Romans at Carrhæ noticed that while the chiefs
wore their hair parted and curled and their faces painted in the Persian
fashion, the warriors had the unkempt locks of barbarian Thrace. It is
likely enough that these Parthian bowmen had come in round the shores of
the Black Sea from Thrace or South Russia. They had all the
characteristics of northern nomads, but their kings had a good deal of
Hellenic culture. They could boast of a choice collection of Roman
eagles captured not only from Crassus at Carrhæ, but from two armies
sent against them by Antony. Thousands of Roman prisoners were still
working as slaves on the banks of the Euphrates. The task of punishing
them had been definitely laid upon Augustus as a legacy from Julius, who
had been slain at the moment when he was about to undertake it himself.
Moreover, the Romans felt the loss of those standards very acutely, and
not the least motive for their acquiescence in monarchy had been the
hope that a monarch would retrieve their honour in this quarter. The
earlier poems of Horace constantly express hopes of vengeance.</p>

<p>The manner in which Augustus satisfied these ardent aspirations of
national pride is characteristic of him. Instead of the armies and
bloody battles which historians demand of their favourites, Augustus
achieved his object by luck and strategy. When he was organising the
affairs of the East in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_198" id="page_198">{198}</a></span> 29 <small>B.C.</small>, after the conquest of Egypt, he had
left the Parthian question unsolved. For this, Mommsen takes him to
task, but there is little doubt that it would have been folly to
undertake a great and perilous war at that moment while the affairs of
Rome were still in disorder. Moreover the attitude of the army compelled
him to return home. Instead of fighting, he was content to set up rival
powers on the Parthian frontier. The Parthians hated their king Phraates
and there was a deposed rival in the field, Tiridates, to whom Augustus
now gave shelter in the province of Syria, hoping, as indeed happened,
that his presence in the neighbourhood would keep Phraates civil. At the
same time Augustus set up a buffer kingdom of Lesser Armenia on the
Parthian border and in the south strengthened and reinstated Herod the
Great. Four or five legions were left to guard Syria.</p>

<p>In 23 <small>B.C.</small> it chanced that Tiridates had managed to kidnap the child of
Phraates and was keeping him in custody in the Roman province. It is
significant of the changed relations between Parthia and Rome that,
instead of marching into Syria to recover the child, Phraates sent an
embassy to Rome, whither also Tiridates came in person. Of course the
senate made the restoration of the child conditional upon the return of
the standards and prisoners. Phraates consented, but there was some
delay in carrying out the contract and this may have been secretly
arranged to enable Augustus to conduct the affair in a more striking
fashion. Augustus marched out with an army and at his mere approach the
standards and captives were given up with due formalities. It was really
a Roman triumph, almost as great as if it had been attained by
bloodshed, for all the world could see the humiliation of Parthia.
Augustus, that astute tactician, took care that the event should not be
allowed to lose its impressiveness for the mere lack of bloodshed. The
return of the standards was treated as a Roman triumph. They were placed
with every solemnity in the temple of Mars the Avenger. Coins were
struck representing the suppliant Parthian on his knees and the same
scene is depicted in relief<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_199" id="page_199">{199}</a></span> on the centre of Cæsar’s breastplate on the
famous statue. The poets broke out into dutiful pæans.</p>

<p class="nind">cries Ovid. Vergil, after his manner, speaks of the Euphrates flowing
more quietly in future. The odes of Horace and the elegies of Propertius
contain similar loyal allusions. Ferrero, who regards Augustus as a
feeble trickster just as he regards Julius as a shabby adventurer, has
nothing but contempt for this episode. But seeing that the Parthians
were now utterly weakened by their internal feuds and quite submissive
to Rome it would have been folly to embark upon their conquest. That
they gave much trouble in the future is true enough, but that might
fairly be left for the future to deal with. Extermination might have
quieted them for ever, but Augustus had really no excuse for making war
upon them.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>Surrender of the Standards</p></div>

<p>On the same visit to the East a still more elaborate system of buffer
states forming a double semicircle round Parthia was organised. Armenia
yielded to Rome and received at the hands of Tiberius a new king who had
been educated at Rome. Augustus himself explains that although he might
have made Armenia into a Roman province he preferred to follow the
example of “our ancestors” and give the crown to a native king. Augustus
never pretended to be a world-conqueror. Similarly Media Atropatene
received a new king of Roman education, so did Commagene and Emesa.
These formed the outer ring of buffer states.</p>

<p>The central state behind them was Galatia, an arid highland district
inhabited by the descendants of those Gauls who had burst into the Greek
world under Brennus. Though they had acquired some tincture of Greek
civilisation and had a capital of some importance at Ancyra, they still
spoke the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_200" id="page_200">{200}</a></span> Gaulish language and were still a warlike race. For these
reasons, on the death of their king, Augustus preferred to turn their
country into a province. To the north was the very friendly kingdom of
Polemo in Pontus, and to the south other friendly princedoms as well as
the Roman provinces of Cilicia, Syria, and Cyprus.</p>

<p>For all this elaborate bulwark, the Parthian question was not really
settled. They continued to exercise an undue influence in Armenia, and
in <small>A.D.</small> 1 there was another solemn mission to the East and a conference
between Phraates the Parthian king and Gaius the grandson of Augustus.
Once more the Parthian professed submission, and once more the court
poets struck their obsequious lyres. When Phraates died, his uncle
Orodes who succeeded ruled with such cruelty that he was assassinated.
Thereupon the Parthians sent to Rome for a king and Augustus gave them a
nephew of the murdered tyrant, a youth also of Roman education. We note
this proceeding as common in the foreign policy of Augustus. He must
have had something like a school for young barbarian princes at Rome,
but whether the lessons that they learnt in Roman society were
altogether salutary is doubtful.</p>

<p>Behind this wall the great provinces of Asia, Syria, and Bithynia were
wrapped in profound security. Here Greek culture continued to flourish
with periodical incursions of oriental religion and philosophy. In every
considerable town the Jews formed a great and growing section of the
population but even they were half Greek in their ways of life. The
country was rich and lazy and utterly unwarlike. Civilisation had risen
to a high pitch and it was probably this part of the world which sent to
Rome those artists who contributed to the revival of sculpture. Pretty
little epigrams in Greek elegiacs seem to have been their principal
literary accomplishment. These provinces have very little
history&mdash;happily for them&mdash;at this period. We know them best from the
Acts of the Apostles, where we get a glimpse of their superstitions,
their eagerness to embrace new religions. We see the fanaticism of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_201" id="page_201">{201}</a></span>
Ephesus with its magnificent temple of Diana and stately worship, a
religion of oriental character overlaid with Greek culture, and only
rivalled in its attractions by the Roman amphitheatre. For these people
as for the rest of the world Augustus had his policy. Since worship was
their instructive need and Euhemerism had accustomed them to worship
men, he set up an elaborate cult of himself, or rather, by a subtle
distinction without a difference, a cult of “the genius of Augustus.”
Temples were built to “Rome and Augustus” and an elaborate hierarchy of
“High Priests,” “Asiarchs,” and “Bithyniarchs,” which became the highest
social distinctions in the society of the day. This was his method of
securing the allegiance of nations devoted to religion and flattery.
Here in the near future was to be the field of that momentous conflict
between this State religion and Christianity, with other oriental
faiths, such as Mithraism, also claiming their proselytes.</p>

<p>As for old Greece, the Romans never denied their spiritual debt to her,
and accordingly they regarded Greece with something of the veneration
which a man feels for his university. Augustus himself had been educated
at Apollonia, he sent his heirs to various Greek cities for their
education. It would have seemed sacrilege to educated Romans to put a
legate in charge of Athens. Hence we find Greece enjoying quite an
exceptional position in the empire, indeed without exception the freest
and most favoured part of it. Towns such as Athens, Lacedæmon, Thespiæ,
Tanagra, Platæa, Delphi, and Olympia were free and almost sovereign.
Athens continued to coin her silver drachms with the old design of
Pallas and the owl, elected her own archons and generals, held
assemblies and even had a sort of empire extending over all Attica, part
of Bocotia and five islands of the Cyclades. One Julius Nicanor, her
“new Themistocles,” purchased the island of Salamis and presented it to
his city in the civilised manner of empire-building. Sparta, too, though
now shrunken to the size of a village, bore rule over Northern Laconia,
while in the south there was a free confederacy to keep her in order.
Beside these cities of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_202" id="page_202">{202}</a></span> ancient renown stood the new and splendid
creation of Augustus&mdash;Nicopolis, the city of victory founded on the
promontory of Actium in commemoration of the great victory of 31.
Nicopolis had its great athletic festival like Olympia and ruled over a
considerable territory. In addition to these free cities there were some
Roman colonies. Corinth rose again from her ashes as an important
commercial city founded by Julius Cæsar. Patras, on the Corinthian Gulf,
a new foundation of Augustus, became one of the most important cities of
Greece, as it is to-day. The rest of Southern Greece, consisting mainly
of obscure villages, formed the new senatorial province of Achaia and
was governed by a proconsul at Corinth. It was a poor unmilitary
province. The northern part formed the senatorial province of Macedonia.
Thessalonica and Apollonia were the principal centres of government and
civilisation in this region. In Greece, as elsewhere, Augustus made it
his aim to focus a national unity upon religion. The old Achæan league
was revived as a religious gathering with Argos for its centre, and the
Delphic Amphictyony, the oldest surviving institution in Europe, became
the basis of a Panhellenic confederacy which met annually for religious
purposes under Roman patronage, a sort of Eisteddfod combining religion
with culture. It sacrificed to Cæsar, and here, too, we find a president
called “Helladarch.” But although Greece had liberty and peace,
something was amiss with her. Her shrunken population continued to
decline. In Strabo’s Geography, Thebes is a mere village.</p>

<p>Crossing the water we find that the newly conquered kingdom of Egypt was
the key to the whole position of Augustus. It was the wealth of Egypt
which had reconciled Rome to monarchy and it was by means of that wealth
that he continued to hold the allegiance of his subjects. Like Greece it
had an ancient civilisation which impressed the Romans as something
beyond their comprehension. Alexandria, in particular, as the gateway to
the wealth of Egypt, and as the greatest existing centre of Greek
culture, not to mention its huge population<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_203" id="page_203">{203}</a></span> and commercial advantages,
seemed to the Romans a really dangerous rival. The fear of that rivalry
had been felt very acutely at Rome when news came of the ambitious
schemes of Cleopatra and the subservience of Antony. Augustus was really
heading something like a national crusade when he declared war upon
them. The same fears now actuated him in settling the treatment of Egypt
as a province. Though he writes “I added Egypt to the Roman empire,” he
treated it rather as an imperial domain under a prefect or viceroy
closely attached to his interests. Its first prefect was Cornelius
Gallus, a knight from the Gallic colony of Fréjus, a poet himself and a
friend of Vergil. Cornelius Gallus was in fact the hero of the famous
eclogue: <i>neget quis carmina Gallo?</i> It was specially ordained that no
senator might visit Egypt without the express permission of Cæsar. The
native Egyptians were already overridden by a Greek aristocracy dating
from Alexander’s conquest. They had no rights, and no nationality was
designed for them as it had been elsewhere. Augustus accepted the
elaborate bureaucratic system which he had found in existence when he
came. The Greek aristocracy lived almost exclusively in Alexandria,
possessing a municipal constitution, magistracy, and priesthood of their
own. The <i>ecclesia</i> was stopped but otherwise there was no attempt to
Romanise Egypt. The old Egyptian worship of Isis and Osiris had
conquered all its conquerors and continued to make inroads even into
Rome itself where Augustus was forced to accept it as irresistible. All
that had happened in Egypt was that Augustus had taken the place of the
Ptolemies in the official religion. It was the motive of fear which led
to the appointment of a mere knight as viceroy, though he had three
legions under his command. The officials under him were knights or
freedmen. The taxes remained very heavy, as was necessary, but now the
Egyptians were placed in a better position to pay them. Even before the
civil war was quite ended in 29 <small>B.C.</small> Augustus had employed his soldiers
to clear the canals and raise the level of the dams which ensure the
Egyptian harvests.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_204" id="page_204">{204}</a></span> This process continued, and Egypt never had such
prosperity again until Lord Cromer came to resume the work of Augustus.
The harvest depended simply on the height to which the Nile rose. The
ancient Nilometer at Elephantine records that the Nile rose to an
unprecedented height in the latter days of Augustus. Formerly a level of
eight ells had meant famine, now it ensured a tolerable harvest. Another
inscription found at Coptos gives us the names of the Roman soldiers who
built reservoirs of water along the great roads. Then the trade with
India along the Red Sea first began to grow great. Whereas in the time
of Cleopatra hardly twenty ships sailed to India in a year, there was
already in Strabo’s day (about <small>A.D.</small> 18) a great fleet of Indiamen. Taxes
on exports and imports returned a huge revenue to the imperial purse.</p>

<p>The prefect who represented his master on the throne of the Ptolemies
was in a difficult position. To Rome he was a mere servant, to the
Egyptians something like a god. Against these flattering influences
Gallus the poet had not strength to resist. He allowed statues to be
erected to him and even had his own achievements engraved upon the
pyramids. A traitorous friend reported these indiscretions at Rome.
Augustus was content to recall him and forbid him to live in the
provinces or to enter his presence. But the officious senate voted his
condemnation to banishment, and confiscated all his property to
Augustus, whereby Gallus was driven to suicide. Then Augustus was sorry
and complained that it was hard not to be able to scold one’s friends
like a private man. This was the first case of that disease known as
<i>delatio</i> (informing) which was afterwards to become such a pest under
the Empire. It is satisfactory to learn that the informer was very
rudely treated in Roman society. From Egypt, as a base, expeditions were
made in the time of Augustus to Arabia and the Soudan. Arabia Felix was
to the Romans a kind of Eldorado of boundless wealth, as Horace writes
to a friend who was joining the campaign. The Arabs brought their
incense into the Syrian markets and already traded with India from Aden,
but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_205" id="page_205">{205}</a></span> national wealth of the country was exaggerated and its
difficulties unknown. This expedition of 25 <small>B.C.</small>, which was on a very
large scale and included contingents from Judæa, was one of the few
deliberate wars of conquest ever planned by Augustus. He learnt a lesson
by its failure in the burning and trackless deserts. The other campaign
against the black Æthiopians of the Soudan under their warlike but
one-eyed queen Candace was more successful. Petronius the legate
penetrated as far as the Second Cataract and sent a thousand prisoners
to Rome, but Augustus seems to have been content to make the First
Cataract his southern frontier.</p>

<p>The neighbouring client kingdom of Judæa is of importance not only
because the days of Augustus saw the birth of that Child in Bethlehem
who was destined to conquer Rome and through Rome the world, but because
its throne was occupied by the ablest and most remarkable man, next to
Augustus, in the whole Empire. Herod the Great, an Edomite Arab by
birth, had succeeded to the throne of the Maccabees in 37 <small>B.C.</small> He was
not only a daring warrior but a singularly skilful diplomat who was
always able to cover up his crimes by adroit flattery and a fascinating
manner. He was very successful in trimming between the rivals throughout
the civil wars and even shared the favours of Cleopatra with his Roman
masters. In these ways he increased his domains by the addition of
Gadara, Samaria, and the Philistine coast towns. In compliment to
Augustus he refounded Samaria with great splendour as the Greek city of
Sebaste and built Greek theatres, Roman amphitheatres, and baths in
Jerusalem itself. He even instituted quinquennial games there, wherein
naked athletes performed to the infinite disgust of the Jews. He took
his sons to Rome for their education and there he met and fascinated
both Augustus and Agrippa. He even persuaded Agrippa to visit Jerusalem
for the opening of his magnificent new temple in 15 <small>B.C.</small> Agrippa came
and sacrificed a whole hecatomb to Jehovah to the apparent delight of
the people. Later on Herod made a grand tour of Asia Minor, scattering
lavish gifts everywhere<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_206" id="page_206">{206}</a></span> and receiving complimentary inscriptions in
return. He succeeded in obtaining valuable privileges for his
fellow-Jews scattered abroad in those regions. Henceforth they were not
forced to render military service and had special permission to keep the
Sabbath.</p>

<p>In 9 and 8 <small>B.C.</small>, however, he got into trouble with Augustus for
conducting a military expedition against the Arabs without permission.
This was the greatest offence that a client king could commit, and
Augustus declared that henceforth he would treat Herod not as a friend,
but as a subject. But in the next year a humble embassy was sent to Rome
with the historian Nicolaus as its spokesman. Herod received the
gracious permission to deal with his rebellious sons as he thought fit,
and accordingly strangled two of them. Herod’s family history is a
deplorable record of crimes and intrigues. He seems to have had ten
wives, and on his death in 4 <small>B.C.</small>, he left three wills among which
Augustus had to decide. Seeing that Judæa was so rich and powerful as to
be a possible source of danger, he decided to split it up into three.
Then began a whole series of troubles, in the course of which the Jews
of Jerusalem actually attacked a Roman legion. In revenge the legate of
Syria, Quintilius Varus, crucified 2000 of the inhabitants. In the final
award Judæa fell to Archelaus, Galilee to Herod Antipas. Ten years
later, however, the infamous Archelaus was deposed at the petition of
his subjects, and Judæa was made subject to the province of Syria with a
procurator of its own. Herod Antipas continued to rule his petty kingdom
until about <small>A.D.</small> 34, when it also was united to the province. He is the
Herod whom Christ denounced as “that fox,” and he is the Herod of
Christ’s Judgment, when he happened to be at Jerusalem on a visit to
Pontius Pilatus, the Roman procurator. Pilate was a Roman knight, but
Felix, one of his successors, was only a freedman. The seat of the Roman
government was not at Jerusalem, but at Cæsarea, so that the <i>prætorium</i>
in which the trial of Jesus took place must have been the temporary
head-quarters of Pilate in the palace built by Herod the Great.</p>

<p>The procurator only commanded auxiliary troops, and nearly all the
“Roman soldiers” mentioned in the Gospels must have been of Jewish
birth. As soon as it was a province, but not before, Judæa had to pay
tribute to Cæsar. Hence the existence of a “chief of the publicans” like
Zacchæus. As usual, the Romans preserved what they could of native
institutions, and the Sanhedrin continued to act as a national council,
so far as could be permitted. Thus it might try Jesus, but it could not
pronounce the death sentence. On the other hand, another procurator,
Festus, committed Paul to the Sanhedrin for judgment. The fact is that
the Jewish law was so peculiarly national that a bewildered and
well-intentioned Roman knight like Pilate might often say “take ye Him
and judge Him according to your law.” The Roman government was so
tolerant of the religion of its subjects that even a Roman citizen who
ventured to enter the Holy of Holies was punished with death. The Jewish
religion was expressly under Roman protection. Agrippa, as we have seen,
had sacrificed to Jehovah, but later on we find Augustus commending his
grandson Gaius for not having worshipped Jehovah. As a matter of fact,
with the spread of the newer forms of Hellenic philosophy the religious
feeling of the world, which had long ago given up its faith in the
Olympian mythology, was turning more and more towards monotheism and a
mystical system of ethics. The higher Pharisaism, which Paul had learnt
at the feet of Gamaliel, was decidedly influenced by Stoicism. Hence the
Jewish religion even before its Christian development was extremely
fascinating to the Roman mind, and it had to be forbidden in the
capital. Even at Jerusalem the Jews were expected to sacrifice, not <i>to</i>
but <i>for</i> “Cæsar and the Roman People” every day. Augustus paid for this
ritual out of his own pocket. In deference to the feeling of the Jews,
the coins struck for Judæa bore no portrait of Cæsar, and even the
standards, because they bore portraits, were ordered not to be carried
into the Holy City. It is true that the silver denarius of Syria
circulated in Judæa to some extent, and it is of such a coin that
Christ<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_208" id="page_208">{208}</a></span> was speaking when He asked: “Whose image and superscription is
this?”</p>

<p>The province of Africa with Numidia was handed over to the senate as
peaceful in 27 <small>B.C.</small>, and it was one of the only two Roman provinces
which Augustus never visited. Nominally it stretched from the boundary
of the kingdom of Mauretania at the river Ampsaga on the west to the
borders of the Cyrenaica on the east. But actually it consisted of the
islands of fertility on the Tunisian coast. Carthage had been colonised
by Julius Cæsar and was now refounded by Augustus. There was no inland
frontier. In the desert behind the mountains there still flourished the
wild Gætulian nomads who occasionally descended upon the peaceful
province and provided a Roman triumph. This was the reason why a legion
was still kept in Africa. The neighbouring kingdom of Mauretania was
assigned to an interesting young royal couple. The husband was Juba, a
descendant of Masinissa, who had been educated as a Roman, had served in
the Roman army and was so complete a Greek scholar that he wrote among
many other works a history of the Drama. The wife was a daughter of
Cleopatra by Antony, who had ridden in Cæsar’s triumph at Rome. Both
Mauretania and its eastern neighbour Numidia, which had been added to
the Roman province, now settled down to wealth and happiness under the
Roman rule. The splendid ruins which still survive indicate a prosperity
which has not as yet been completely recovered.</p>

<p>Cyrene, where the descendants of the Romans are now carving out a
province for themselves, though geographically a part of the African
continent, was historically regarded as a Greek island, and united in
one province with Crete. It consisted of a group of five Greek cities
with a large intermixture of Jews. Cyrene has no history in this period,
but after the siege of Jerusalem there was a terrible outburst of Jewish
fanaticism. Thousands of Roman citizens were tortured and slain.</p>

<p>Perhaps no country in the world has had such a chequered<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_209" id="page_209">{209}</a></span> and miserable
history as the pleasant island of Sicily with its rich volcanic soil.
For four hundred years it had been mainly Greek. The eastern end, at
least, had been scattered with important city-states which, under the
leadership of Syracuse, had waged incessant conflict with the
Carthaginian invaders in their western strongholds. We have seen how the
Romans finally drove out the Semitic element and conquered the Greeks.
During the latter part of republican history the island had been of
vital importance to Rome as supplying through its tribute the chief part
of the corn-supply. At the same time it had been cruelly exploited and
oppressed by Roman governors like Verres. Then during the civil wars
Sextus Pompeius had made it his head-quarters, and it had been laid
under heavy contributions by both sides. Messina, its richest town, had
been the scene of a sack and massacre. No country had more to hope from
the Pax Augusta, and it now began to enjoy one of its brief periods of
rest. Augustus spent the winter of 22 in Sicily at the beginning of his
tour in Greece. He founded colonies at six famous cities of old. While
he was in the island the Sicilians offered him a kind of round-robin of
complaint against the extortion of his procurator. Augustus instantly
dismissed the offender and replaced him by his own valued tutor, the
philosopher Areus. It was thoroughly in accordance with his policy to
put a Greek philosopher in charge of a Greek island.</p>

<p>So far we have been surveying the treatment of that part of the Roman
world which was already quite civilised and mainly Greek. We now turn to
the barbarian West and North, mainly consisting of newly conquered
Cæsarian provinces. In these quarters, the nearer parts of Spain and the
Narbonensian province of Gaul were the only regions which could be
called civilised. As soon as the provisional settlement of 27 b.c. was
effected Augustus hurried away to Gaul. It was generally thought that he
was on his way to conquer Britain, for that was the second of the two
tasks which Julius had left to his successor. Accordingly the loyal
Horace dutifully prays:<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_210" id="page_210">{210}</a></span></p>

</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">But this was not the time, and Augustus was not the man, for dazzling
conquests. “Hasten slowly” was his favourite motto, and his empire
policy was founded on the same principle. For the present the Ocean,
then called British, was boundary enough. Augustus was reducing the army
and Britain would have taken at least a legion to keep it quiet. So
Britain had to delay its prospects of civilisation until Gaul and Spain
were organised and the German frontier settled. We have the record of
British chiefs coming to Rome with unknown petitions during the period,
but beyond that there is silence on our island. As for Gaul, Julius had
done the work of conquest thoroughly enough, and the Gauls as an
adaptable people were taking to Roman civilisation with avidity. There
were indeed corners of it not yet enlightened and the whole government
required organisation. Augustus went straight to the capital of the old
province, Narbonne, and there he arranged a census and a land register,
not, as Ferrero observes, out of mere statistical curiosity. Probably no
tribute had come in from Gaul during the civil wars, and Augustus was
much concerned with finance. For the moment an outbreak in Spain called
the emperor away, but five years later he returned to complete his work.
The old province, which has passed into history as Provence, was now
handed back to the senate as completely pacified, and the rest of Gaul
was eventually divided into three parts: Aquitania, the half-Spanish
south-west; Lugdunensis (the east and centre stretching right across
France with its capital Lyons or Lugdunum on its eastern border); and
Belgica (the northern part with Trier&mdash;Augusta Treverorum, not yet
founded&mdash;and Rheims as its chief towns). This division was mainly,
though not entirely, based on racial considerations. Together the three
formed one of Cæsar’s provinces as Gallia Comata.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_211" id="page_211">{211}</a></span></p>

HADRIAN’S WALL: NEAR HOUSESTEADS, NORTHUMBERLAND</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The treatment of the conquered land was wise and humane. Druidical
religion, already a waning force, was permitted to exist, though it
included human sacrifice and was hostile to the Romans. In the reign of
Claudius it was forbidden. But other native deities were actually
encouraged by the state, and Augustus himself built an altar to some
strange Gallic spirits. But side by side with the native religion he
fostered the new cult, as in Asia, of “Rome and Augustus.” There had
always been tribal councils which culminated in a great national
gathering at Lugdunum once a year. Apparently the presiding priests had
been elected from the well-born natives and were in opposition to the
Druids. Augustus made skilful use of this organisation and fostered it
in order to make it a centre for Roman patriotism. He set up a great
altar at Lugdunum inscribed “to Rome and Augustus.” It was constructed
in a sacred grove, and was surrounded by statues emblematic of the sixty
Gallic tribes. The elected priest had to be a Roman citizen of Gallic
birth. It soon became a distinction coveted by the grandsons of those
who had fought against Julius. This is very characteristic of the
systematic empire-building which went on in the days of Augustus.
Lugdunum rose to be a great imperial city, the only city in Gaul which
possessed full Roman citizenship and had a mint of its own. From it a
great and elaborate road system radiated to all parts of France very
much in the same directions as the modern railways. Schools were founded
and the study of Latin encouraged though not enforced. The Gauls took
very ardently to their new studies, displaying in particular a
remarkable faculty for rhetoric. The principle came into force that when
a town or district could show that it spoke Latin it received important
rights of citizenship, including that great privilege, the use of Roman
law. The land system of Gaul differed essentially from that of Italy in
that it was based on tribes and cantons instead of cities. Already the
towns were growing as centres for the tribes, but to this day many of
the names of French cities are those of tribes rather than towns: thus
Lutetia of the Parisii<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_212" id="page_212">{212}</a></span> is Paris, Durocortorum of the Remi is Rheims,
Divodurum of the Mediomatrici is Metz, and Agedincum of the Senones is
Sens. The tribute ultimately fixed was a high one but on the whole
justly regulated. It is probable that the ugly story of Licinius and his
extortions is told as an exceptional occurrence. In any case Gaul was
taught how to grow rich and prosperous. Mines of silver and gold were
successfully exploited, the culture of flax was encouraged, and the soil
was found to be admirably suited to cereal crops. Gaul became a hive of
industry and a source of ever-increasing wealth. She purchased oil and
wine from Italy as well as the articles of Eastern luxury which passed
through the hands of Roman merchants. A 2½ per cent. duty was charged at
the frontier both on imports and exports. Such were some of the methods
by which the Romanisation of Gaul was effected, and the foundations so
well and truly laid that through all the invasions of Franks and
Burgundians, Gaul remained Roman in speech and thought, and remains so
to this day.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>Of all the momentous problems which Augustus had to face, the
delimitation of the northern frontier was the weightiest. It has always
been one of the disputed questions of Roman history, why Augustus, who
was generally so cautious and so unwilling to embark upon adventures,
deliberately chose to cross the Rhine and plunge into those impenetrable
forests of whose dangers and difficulties Julius Cæsar had left so clear
a warning. Was it his aim to forestall the danger of a German invasion
of Gaul? On the other hand, the Rhine might well seem a sufficient
frontier, as indeed for many centuries it was. Was it his aim to
exercise his troops in difficult warfare and perhaps secure military
renown for the young men whom he had destined for the succession? These
are scarcely adequate motives for a man like Augustus. Did he hope to
acquire wealth out of Germany as he had done out of Gaul? He must have
known that the virgin forests and undrained morasses of Germany would
scarcely balance the difficulties and dangers of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_213" id="page_213">{213}</a></span> a campaign there, and
that the Germans were far behind their Gallic cousins in civilisation.
The problem seems to me insoluble unless we accept the theory that the
whole scheme was part of the search for a natural strategic frontier
undertaken with false notions of geography. It is certain that many of
the ancients believed that they would find the Ocean again where Russia
is, and that the Caspian Sea was part of it. In that case the Romans may
have hoped to round off their empire satisfactorily in this direction.
It would explain the curious tactics by which Roman expeditions crossing
the Rhine and plunging into the heart of Germany ordered their fleets to
coast along the Dutch and Danish shores.</p>

<p>From whatever motives it was undertaken, this penetration of Germany and
its ultimate failure was a fact of vast consequence in the history of
Europe. From one point of view the history of Europe may be described as
a record of the various relations between the Roman and the German
elements, with occasional incursions from the Celtic or Turanian
fringes. It is one long contest between Latin and Teutonic race,
religion, language, law, and ideas political and economic. Hence it is
impossible to overrate the importance of the moment when the first round
of that age-long contest was fought out and settled. Hidden among the
forests in those mysterious wildernesses beyond the Rhine were the
numerous tribes who were destined one day to form the nations of Europe.
Here were the Saxons of Saxony and England, the Swabians, the Franks,
the Vandals, the Burgundians, the Goths, the Lombards, and many others,
yet unnamed, the germs of the nations.</p>

<p>It was by no means their first entrance on the stage of history. We
believe that the dominant races of historical Greece, and perhaps of
historical Rome, traced back their ancestry to the central regions of
Europe. Since then history had recorded several alarming incursions of
northern barbarians, and in a general sense the story of the
Mediterranean peoples shows how wave after wave of strong warriors from
the North descended upon the fertile peninsulas of the South, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_214" id="page_214">{214}</a></span>
always absorbed and assimilated them, until finally they became a prey
to the enervating influences of climate, melted into the native strain,
and had to make room for a fresh wave of untamed northerners. Read in
this light, extraordinary interest attaches to the moment when
all-conquering Rome attempted to conquer the wilds which sheltered these
mighty tribes. If she had succeeded in taming and Romanising the Germans
also, as she had done with the Spaniards and Gauls, the course of
history might have been very different. But even then, though she knew
it not, behind the Teutonic peoples lay the Slavs, and behind them the
Tartars and the Huns. The task of civilising the world from a single
centre was impossible. Augustus would have been wiser to choose a strong
frontier first and then proceed gradually by peaceful penetration.
Probably Augustus judged that the policy of buffer states which he had
applied in the East was not applicable to barbarians. As it was,
conquest was the method he selected, contrary to his usual custom and
contrary to his natural inclination. Herein success led to
over-confidence and so to disaster.</p>

<p>We always term the people over the wall “barbarians,” but the Germans
had their various political and social systems and some of their tribes
were more civilised than others. By comparing the <i>Commentaries</i> of
Cæsar with the <i>Germania</i> of Tacitus we get a fairly comprehensive
notion of German institutions, which, it must be remembered, were those
of our own ancestors. They had no cities. Like the Gauls they were
grouped in tribes and the tribes were subdivided into cantons, the
cantons into villages. They lived on the produce of their flocks and
herds, on the chase, and on a primitive type of “extensive” agriculture,
which involved fresh ploughlands every year and thus caused continual
unrest and jostling of tribe against tribe. This was what made them such
troublesome neighbours to the Gauls, and led to those gigantic “treks”
which meet us from time to time in history. Their only political system
was a fighting organisation; hereditary chiefs and princes led them in
battle and the general in a large<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_215" id="page_215">{215}</a></span> movement was elected from amongst the
princes by the freemen of the tribe. In peace there was no general
magistracy, but the elders and priests administered justice in the
villages. Among the warriors there was a rough freedom and equality. The
free warrior had very considerable rights, but only as a warrior. Among
the Suevi, according to Cæsar, there were a hundred cantons, each of
which furnished a thousand men to the army for a year’s service while
the rest stayed at home to carry on agriculture and hunting. But this
seems, if it is accurate, to be an exceptional degree of organisation.
The chastity, the patriotism, the honesty of these barbarians as well as
their courage and gigantic stature were favourite themes for Roman
eloquence. It is likely enough that Tacitus heightened their virtues
with his satirical instinct in order to point a moral to his
fellow-countrymen.</p>

PORTA NIGRA, TRIER, GERMANY</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Julius Cæsar had left the Rhine as the frontier of his Gallic provinces,
though he had crossed it twice by way of reconnaissance. Quite at the
beginning of Augustus’s presidency, the Suevi had had to be chased back
across the Rhine, and the Treveri across the Moselle. At this time,
Germany was still for administrative purposes a part of the Gallic
provinces, and as a rule there was some high officer in charge of both.
The Rhine was not impassable to the barbarians, and moreover there were
Germanic tribes on both sides of it, such as the Treveri of Trier and
the Ubii of Cologne, who were in frequent intercourse with their
neighbours on the other side. This made the river a somewhat
insufficient boundary. There were inroads of German barbarians in 29,
25, 20 and 16 <small>B.C.</small> In the latter case a Roman legate was surprised and
defeated, and the eagle of the Fifth Legion carried off in triumph.</p>

<p>This brought Augustus to the spot, and he spent two years in studying
the problems of Gaul and Germany. In 12 <small>B.C.</small> the first campaign was
undertaken under the command of Drusus, his younger stepson. Drusus, who
was not yet twenty-five, was the most brilliant figure of his day,
brave, handsome, virtuous, adored by the soldiers, and a thoroughly
capable<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_216" id="page_216">{216}</a></span> general. On this occasion he crossed the Rhine and descended
into Dutch territory, laying waste the lands of the Sygambri and the
other hostile tribes who had provoked these punitive measures. He
accepted the submission of the Frisians who lived on the coast of North
Holland. During the winter his troops seem to have been employed in
cutting a canal from the Rhine to the Zuyder Zee. Next year he crossed
again, marched on, and threw a bridge across the Lippe, crossed the
territory of the Cherusci&mdash;the most warlike of all the tribes&mdash;and
halted on the banks of the Weser. He built a great fort at the junction
of the Lippe and the Alme or Ems, and cut a highway along the banks of
the Lippe to join the new fort Aliso with a great camp on the Rhine near
Xanten. In the next year there was more building and settling, and in 9
<small>B.C.</small> came the great effort. Drusus marched out into Suabia and
Cheruscia, crossed the Weser, ravaging everywhere, and reached the Elbe.
This river he essayed to cross, but he could not, and, as the historians
put it, omens appeared to forbid further progress. This then was the
Roman limit. Somewhere between the Saale and the Weser, Drusus fell from
his horse and sustained injuries which resulted in his death. Augustus,
though greatly grieved, determined to continue his operations. Tiberius
was sent to continue the work, and 40,000 Sygambrians were transported
into Roman territory.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="nind">We know little of the work of the next dozen
years. Another legate reached the Elbe. A great viaduct was constructed
between the Ems and the Rhine. During this period the pacification was
apparently proceeding with rapidity. Many of the young Germans came into
the Roman camp and learnt Roman ways and Latin speech. The head-quarters
were still at Vetera Castra near Xanten and at Mogontiacum (Mainz), with
summer quarters at Aliso. In <small>A.D</small>. 4 fresh campaigns were undertaken by
Tiberius. For many of these expeditions the Roman historians offer no
excuse or justification. They record with pride the immense slaughter
and devastation that accompanied them. It is hard to resist the
conclusion that much of this fighting was undertaken for<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_217" id="page_217">{217}</a></span> its own sake,
or to exercise the legions. In <small>A.D.</small> 5 the greatest expedition of all was
undertaken. There was a great “durbar” at which the wild Chauci and
Cherusci handed in their weapons and did obeisance to the Roman general.
The Langobardi&mdash;later known as the Lombards&mdash;submitted, and Tiberius
crossed the Elbe itself, while the fleet which had “circumnavigated the
recesses of the Ocean” sailed up the river to meet the army with
supplies. All seemed to be going well: Germany was nearly conquered.
There only remained the powerful kingdom of the Marcomanni under King
Marbod, who dwelt in the fastnesses of Bohemia. Marbod was an able ruler
who alone in Germany had succeeded in establishing a strong throne, and
had drilled a powerful army of 70,000 foot and 4000 horse. As the
historian Velleius observes, his Alpine boundaries were only two hundred
miles from Italy, and this formidable power was a real menace to the
safety of the empire. Accordingly elaborate plans were made for his
destruction by an invasion from three sides at once. Unfortunately just
at the moment when the armies were converging upon their prey, there
broke out the great Pannonian and Illyrian revolt of <small>A.D.</small> 6, which
brought all the tribes of Austria down upon the Romans. It was one of
the most dangerous moments in Roman history. Fifteen legions were
employed against them, and the military resources of the Empire strained
almost to breaking-point. Luckily for Rome, Marbod made no attempt to
join the revolt, and the barbarians were under divided leadership.
Germanicus, the son of Drusus, helped Tiberius to crush them, but it
took three or four years to accomplish it.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 102px;"><a name="Varus" id="Varus"></a>

<img src="images/image063_sml.jpg" width="102" height="105" alt="[Image unavailable.]" /></a>
<div class="caption"><p>Portrait of Varus</p></div>
</div>

<p>Meanwhile Germany itself had to be content with inferior legates.
Quintilius Varus was one of those amiable men who cause mutinies by
kindness. He fancied that Germany was tranquil. He went about founding
cities, holding assizes, collecting tribute and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_218" id="page_218">{218}</a></span> giving justice
according to Roman law precisely “as if he had been a city prætor in the
Forum at Rome and not a general in the German forests.” Accordingly in
<small>A.D.</small> 9 a plot was hatched against him. He was enticed away into the
recesses of the Saltus Teutoburgiensis and slaughtered. Then the
Cheruscan army swept down upon the three Roman legions and destroyed
them.</p>

<p>In itself the disaster was not overwhelming. Three legions had perished,
but fifteen more, flushed with their recent victory over the Illyrians,
were at hand to avenge them. The Cheruscans immediately submitted and
Germanicus found no serious opposition when he penetrated Germany on an
errand of chastisement. But for Augustus the reverse was decisive. He
was now an old enfeebled man. When he heard of the disaster he beat his
head against the wall and was often heard to cry: “Varus, give me back
my legions.” He saw that there was no end to these adventures in the
forest and no profit in them. As a frontier the Elbe was no better than
the Rhine. Therefore he had the supremely good sense to accept the Rhine
as his frontier. Henceforth Rhine and Danube with roads and forts along
them, and with special arrangements to strengthen the angle where the
rivers run small&mdash;that should be bulwark enough for the present. And so
it was.</p>

<p>The patriotism of German historians has made of this defeat of Varus
rather more than it deserves. Arminius the young Cheruscan who led the
attack was a patriot though a traitor. He had been, says Velleius, a
faithful ally in previous campaigns and had even attained Roman
citizenship and equestrian rank. He spoke Latin fluently. His very name
is most probably a Latin <i>cognomen</i>, though the patriotism of the
Germans will call him “Hermann.” So the German student of to-day sings
over his beer:</p>

lady, Boadicea, but it had the merit of success. The Germans were able
to develop their strength behind the artificial ramparts of the Rhine
and Danube until the time came for them to burst through in conquest.</p>

<p>It is commonly said that Augustus immediately after <small>A.D.</small> 9 formed two
provinces called Upper and Lower Germany along the Rhine as if to
conceal his loss of the real Germany. This is not exact. In the warfare
of Tiberius’s days the historians speak only of the Upper or the Lower
Army in Germany, and Augustus in his monument speaks of Germany in the
singular. Under Tiberius ample revenge was taken for the defeat and
Germanicus again and again traversed Germany. The Varus disaster was
only one of the episodes which decided the Romans to halt at the Rhine.
Aliso was long retained as an outpost, and colonies of Roman veterans
were planted on German soil. The Cheruscans and Arminius were defeated
in a tremendous battle at Idistavisus near Minden on the Weser in <small>A.D.</small>
16. But on the way back the Roman fleet was shipwrecked and a great many
prisoners fell into the hands of the Germans. Some of these were sold as
slaves to the Britons and many eventually returned to Rome bringing back
marvellous stories of their adventures. As for Marbod, he was defeated
in a battle with the Cheruscans and took refuge on Roman soil, where he
lived for eighteen years at Ravenna. Arminius, his conqueror, began to
play the tyrant in his native tribe and was slain by the treachery of
his kinsmen at the age of thirty-seven. His wife Thusnelda and his son
had long ago fallen into the hands of the Romans and the boy grew up as
a Roman citizen.</p>

<p>The headquarters of the Rhine legions continued to be at Mainz and
Xanten with summer quarters at the new Colonia which became Cologne.
Four legions of the Upper Army were stationed at the former, and four of
the Lower Army at the latter. In due course, we cannot say when, these
became the centres of two separate provinces. On the Danube there were
three legions in Pannonia, the great new Austrian province.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_220" id="page_220">{220}</a></span> Along this
frontier there was now a double line of Cæsarian provinces. Rhætia and
Noricum were conquered in 15 <small>B.C.</small> Then there were tedious and
unprofitable campaigns in the southern Swiss valleys as the result of
which a row of little Alpine prefectures was established. There is still
a fine monument to Augustus on the heights above Monaco enumerating
forty-six Alpine tribes made subject to Rome. It was erected by the
gratitude of the Italian farmers, for the Alpine tribes had always
scourged the plains. Roads were constructed here and there over the
Alps. The principal pass to Germany lay by way of Turin and the St.
Bernard with Augusta (Aosta) to guard it. In Pannonia the old route from
Aquilegia over the Julian Alps was restored and a new <i>Via Claudia</i>
constructed up the valley of the Adige from Tridentum (Trent) to Augusta
(Augsburg). To round off the Danube frontier Mœsia or Mysia was
conquered quite at the beginning of the period and added as an Imperial
province, probably in <small>A.D.</small> 6, under a prefect. It stretched along the
south bank of the Danube, down to the Black Sea, and embraced part of
the Balkan high lands. Thus with strong legions posted in permanent
encampments all along the Rhine and Danube, Rome had now a satisfactory
northern frontier which only required guarding to keep Rome and Italy in
security.</p>

<p>Spain had never been entirely subjugated though it had been in the
possession of the Republic for nearly two centuries. Parts of it indeed
were almost as Roman as Rome. Gades and Corduba, for example, were
centres of learning and literature, soon to produce citizens of renown
in Lucan, Seneca, Martial, Quintilian, and an emperor in Trajan&mdash;a most
distinguished galaxy. But a great part of Spain was still in the hands
of wild and chivalrous barbarians. Particularly in the north-west the
Cantabrians and Asturians were a menace to the peaceful province. For
eight years and more the Romans continued to fight them with brief
intervals termed “victories.” Augustus himself came over in 26 <small>B.C.</small> and
directed operations comfortably from Tarraco. The leader of the rebels
was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_221" id="page_221">{221}</a></span> hero-chief called Corocotta who so exasperated the Romans that</p>

<p class="nind">Augustus offered £10,000 for his capture. This sum the brigand earned by
walking into the Roman camp to surrender, and Augustus, charmed at the
idea, gave him his liberty as well as the reward. He married a Roman
wife and died a Roman citizen as Gaius Julius Caracuttus. Cæsar himself
fell seriously ill in the course of the long campaign. Both sides
increased in ferocity. The Romans crucified their prisoners and the
Spaniards mocked them from the cross. Finally Augustus had to send for
Agrippa to finish the business, which he did in 19 <small>B.C.</small> Now Spain was
really conquered for ever and even the northern highlanders laid down
their arms and accepted civilisation. Bætica, the southern part of the
peninsula, was given to the senate to govern, and the northern half
divided into the two imperial provinces, Tarraconensis and Lusitania,
the latter corresponding roughly to modern Portugal. In Spain also
altars were erected to Rome and Augustus. Roads radiated out from
Tarraco. Many towns were founded, such as Cæsar Augusta (Saragossa),
Augusta Emerita (Merida), Pax Julia (Beja), Legiones (Leon), Asturica
Augusta (Astorga). The Celtic religion and probably the very language
quickly became extinct. Even in the time of Augustus there were fifty
communities with full Roman citizenship. New mines were discovered and
vigorously worked, new industries, especially in metal, carefully
fostered.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This brief and imperfect sketch of the Roman Empire, as it took shape
under the all-seeing eye of Augustus, should indicate, more than all the
triumphs she won in battle, more, even, than the story of the Punic
Wars, the real “Grandeur that was Rome.” The true greatness of the Roman
lies in his indomitable energy and his practical good sense, not to be
obscured by the surface of rhetorical culture which had come to overlay
it in these latter generations. Now that Rome had at last secured for
herself a reasonably secure and sensible form of government, she was
able to exercise her natural capacity for<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_222" id="page_222">{222}</a></span> affairs and to play the part
which destiny had assigned to her of propagating civilisation throughout
Europe. If the historians would allow us, we should gladly turn away
from the wars and proscriptions to study the quiet useful work which she
was performing now and henceforth in every corner of her empire. The
motive was, no doubt, self-interest, but it was that broad and
far-seeing selfishness which in the realm of public affairs is the
nearest approach to altruism. The Republic that sucked the blood of her
provinces is detestable to all right-thinking men. The autocracy that
cleared out the canals in Egypt, planted flax and encouraged pottery in
Gaul, irrigated Africa and taught agriculture to the Moorish nomads, set
the wild Iberians to mining and weaving, built aqueducts and roads
everywhere, established a postal system and policed land and sea so
effectively that a man might fare from York to Palmyra, or from Trier to
Morocco “with his bosom full of gold,” may be tyranny governing in its
own interests, but it is an institution for which the world has every
reason to be grateful.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_223" id="page_223">{223}</a></span></p>

/></span>HROUGHOUT his great task of repairing a world which had fallen to
pieces, Augustus was by no means ignorant of the fact that it is the
“spirit that maketh alive.” Indeed it was his constant endeavour to
alter facts without changing their names. He was well aware that Sulla
had failed miserably when he tossed the Romans a constitution and left
nothing but an oath to support it. To adjust frontiers and organise new
provinces with the help of his trusty and invincible little legionaries
was probably the pleasantest and the easiest part of Cæsar’s task. To
reform the ancient imperial city with her centuries of proud and brutal
tradition was equally essential, but it was desperate work. For the
Empire of Augustus was born into the world suffering from degeneration
of the heart. The nobility, upon which everything that was great and
glorious in Roman history depended, was morally corrupt, intellectually
inert, spiritually void, and even physically decrepit and sterile. The
civil wars and proscriptions had systematically pruned away all that was
virile and spirited in its ranks. The trimmers and nonentities had
survived. The women, long since deprived of the iron control which had
kept them in order under the old system of the Roman family, dominated
society with an influence that<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_224" id="page_224">{224}</a></span> was generally evil. The Roman boudoir
with its throng of slaves and parasites was not only profligate, but it
had already begun to produce the type of murderous intriguers which we
meet more prominently in the Messalinas and Faustinas of imperial
history. But as there were virtuous exceptions like Octavia and
Agrippina among the women, so there were among the men a few nobles of
probity and honour who had somehow, probably by hiding themselves away
on their country estates, survived all the conflicts of the past
generation. But these, who read Roman history in the same light as Livy,
were lovers of the old regime, suspicious and bitterly jealous of the
new. We have seen that one of the first official acts of Augustus was to
restore the patriciate. But it is easier to make peers than patricians,
and we may be sure that there was little love between the old
aristocracy and the new. Augustus himself, though the “son of the god
Julius” and descended through his mother from Venus and Anchises, was on
the father’s side only just respectable. By nature and instinct,
however, he was an aristocrat. All his life long he strove to win over
the aristocracy to the support of his regime. But he failed, and failed
disastrously. Whence throughout the history of the Empire we have in
existence more or less prominently a conservative opposition of old
nobles, genuine or spurious, sometimes plotting manfully and dying
nobly, but more often sneering and writing in secret against the
emperors.</p>

<p>But most of the old aristocracy lacked the spirit to oppose Augustus.
The few plots which came to light were contemptible affairs. Some of the
nobles came down to the senate and devoted their intellects to the
choice of a new <i>cognomen</i> for the new Cæsar, or vied with one another
in proposing fresh titles of honour for him. But they soon discovered
that flattery was not very lucrative in the face of their chilly and
statuesque master. Politics at Rome had lost their savour when there was
no chance of blood to follow. The noble senators had to be coerced into
attending at the curia; they devoted their gifts to drawing-room
battles, they collected <i>objets<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_225" id="page_225">{225}</a></span> de luxe</i>, they wrote bad verses and
sometimes bad histories, and they practised all the vices. They had no
religion and very little philosophy. Above all the old Roman family upon
which the piers of Roman society had rested was now in ruins. To be the
husband of one wife from marriage to death was, so far as the records
go, a rare exception. This was no innovation of the Empire. For a
century or more men had changed their wives every few years for the sake
of a fortune or a political alliance.</p>

<p>Augustus set before himself, as one of the most important phases of his
task of regeneration, the moral purification of this society. He had
provided the provinces with a new religion which involved a new social
organisation. But the cloak of republicanism in which he had chosen to
drape his autocracy forbade him to make himself a god in Rome. On the
contrary he steadily forbade extravagant flattery. He was not even to be
called “dominus.” It is true that the mayors of the new boroughs into
which he divided Rome were allowed to set up altars to the Lares and
Genius of Augustus.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> Outside the city throughout Italy there were
temples to Augustus and priests in his service. As usual it was a mere
quibble when he declined divine honours in Rome. Vergil had plainly
called him a god at the very moment when he was dyeing his hands in
Roman blood. Julius Cæsar had been formally deified and Augustus
regularly styled himself “divi filius.” The title of “augustus” itself
carried the notion of transcendent power. Thus the emperor stood on the
threshold of heaven, at any rate for the poorer classes, even in Rome
itself. But for the aristocracy something else was needed: it is of
little profit to claim divinity in a society of atheists. For Roman
society, as typified by Ovid, the gods were little more than a literary
convention, and it would do a respectable man little credit to be
enrolled in their company.</p>

<p>For the reformation of Roman society Augustus had recourse to three
methods&mdash;legislation, culture, and example. The legislation consisted of
a whole series of laws solemnly<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_226" id="page_226">{226}</a></span> passed through senate and comitia in
the years 18 and 17 <small>B.C.</small> To give them additional sanctity they were
called Julian laws. There was one enacting heavier penalties for
adultery, another permitting marriage between citizens and freedwomen,
designed to meet the circumstance that men outnumbered women in the
ranks of the aristocracy. There were also sumptuary laws to curb
extravagance. There were laws imposing penalties on celibacy and
discouraging the fortune-hunters who lay in wait for the rich bachelor’s
legacies. Fiscal privileges were granted to the fathers of families, and
Augustus himself went down to the house and read the senate an old
speech of Metellus on the increase of population. Unfortunately the
emperor himself had not set a good example in the matter of parentage.
He had had three wives but only one child, a daughter. Still he
exhibited himself in the theatre in the capacity of a father by
collecting the children of Germanicus about his knees. Of course
legislation proved quite helpless in the matter, besides arousing a good
deal of ill-feeling which was chiefly displayed in the ranks of the
knights.</p>

<p>Augustus was in a very difficult position when it came to setting an
example. The principal evils which his social code was designed to
remedy were the prevalence of adultery, the frequency of divorce,
voluntary celibacy and formal marriages contracted without intention of
producing offspring, and finally, as a consequence of celibacy, the
prevalence of a regular profession of fortune-hunting. There was
scarcely one of these necessary reforms to which Cæsar himself came with
clean hands. He had begun his matrimonial career by repudiating his
young betrothed; he had then married an immature virgin, and divorced
her for political reasons before the marriage was consummated; in the
third place he had married Scribonia, who had already had two husbands,
and whose son was already a man at the time of her marriage to Augustus.
She was many years older than he, and the marriage was intended to
secure a reconciliation with Sextus Pompeius. This third matrimonial
venture was terminated in a manner which shocked even<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_227" id="page_227">{227}</a></span> Roman society.

</div>
</div>

<p class="nind">On the very day when Scribonia became a mother by him, Augustus put her
away charging her with immorality, though he kept her infant Julia as
his own and only child. He had been fascinated, it seems, by the fair
face and brilliant abilities of Livia Drusilla. Livia was of the highest
ancestry in Rome, a descendant of Appius Claudius, and attached by
adoption to another very noble family, the Livii. Also she had married
another scion of the illustrious Claudian house, the proudest in Rome,
and at the age of fifteen had become the mother of Tiberius. Her father
had chosen the losing side at Philippi, and committed suicide after the
battle. Her husband, Claudius Nero, had taken arms against Augustus&mdash;or
Octavian, as he then was&mdash;in the Perusine War, and his life was
forfeited. His beautiful wife sued the conqueror for mercy, and mercy
was granted upon conditions. Nero was compelled not only to divorce his
wife, but to act the part of a father and give her away in marriage to
Augustus. She was then not only the mother of Tiberius, but just about
to become the mother of Drusus, who was born in the house of Augustus
three months after the marriage. This, then, was the model family on the
Palatine which was to set an example to the Roman aristocracy&mdash;a
daughter whose mother had been divorced on the day of her birth, a
mother who had been sold by her husband, and two stepsons whose father
had been divorced. The sequel scarcely improved matters. Julia grew up
and was married first to the boy Marcellus, then to Agrippa, by whom she
had a large family, and when Agrippa died, Tiberius was forced to put
away his wife, Agrippa’s daughter Vipsania, whom he really loved, and
marry the widow Julia, whose immorality he knew and detested. At last
the profligacy of Julia grew so open and notorious that Augustus was
informed of it and compelled to banish her in company with her mother
Scribonia, who had survived to see her shame. Later on a second Julia,
the daughter of the first, suffered a precisely similar fate.</p>

<p>As for Livia the empress, if we choose to call her by that<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_228" id="page_228">{228}</a></span> title, there
is no doubt that she was a singularly beautiful and clever woman, who
managed to retain the affections of Augustus for over forty years&mdash;in
itself a remarkable feat in Roman society. History records in her favour
many acts of royal mercy and charity. She seconded her husband’s efforts
at reform, and established a powerful ascendancy over him and over
Tiberius. There is no whisper against her chastity when once she entered
the household of Augustus. But on the other hand there are very serious
charges of crime made by contemporaries and recorded by Tacitus, charges
which are supported by the strongest circumstantial evidence. The
suspicion is that she was fighting all her life long without remorse or
scruple for the succession of her son Tiberius. Augustus did not intend
to be succeeded by a Claudius. This he showed again and again in the
most public manner. His aim, as soon as he knew that he was destined to
leave no male offspring of his own body, was to leave the succession in
the sacred Julian line, the family descended from Venus, the house of
the star. But that could only be secured through the female line. His
first choice was the brilliant young Marcellus, son of his sister
Octavia. Marcellus, who had been the first husband of Julia, died of a
mysterious complaint just as he came of age. Then Augustus married Julia
to Agrippa, and two of her sons, Gaius and Lucius, were next chosen for
the succession. They grew up and came of age. Just as they were
beginning public life, Tiberius having been banished to make way for
them, they too died in the same year, Lucius on board ship as he was
sailing to Marseilles, Gaius as the sequel to an assassin’s blow given
him in Armenia. In the first case we have no details. In the second,
Gaius was recovering from his wound, but he turned aside to an obscure
town on the southern coast of Asia Minor, refused the warship which had
been sent to convey him home, and begged to be allowed to live there in
obscurity. The circumstance is full of suspicion and mystery. Moreover,
before his rivals were dead Tiberius had word, from a well-informed
prophet, of their approaching decease, and returned to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_229" id="page_229">{229}</a></span> Rome. He
himself, living in banishment, must be acquitted of active complicity in
the crime. Julia was banished to a lonely island. Her third son was also
put out of sight for no crime but sulkiness and grumbling against his
stepmother. Deprived of all his hopes, Augustus with very marked
reluctance adopted Tiberius, but in his old age he still cherished the
idea of a reconciliation with Julia’s third son, Agrippa Postumus, and
actually visited in secret the remote island where he was interned. But
as soon as Augustus was dead&mdash;and his death was carefully concealed as
long as possible&mdash;Agrippa Postumus was murdered, and this time we have
direct evidence that the crime was Livia’s. This sort of domestic
intrigue, marked by hideous murders, is one of the blackest features of
imperial history at Rome. It arose very largely from the illegitimate
character of the imperial throne, and the absence of any legalised
system of succession.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, out of these unpromising materials Augustus endeavoured to
organise a model Roman family of the old style. Livia and Julia were set
to work at spinning and weaving. Augustus would wear no cloaks but of
their making. Julia was solemnly counselled never to do or say anything
which she would be ashamed to write in her diary. Once when she built a
palace for herself Augustus had it demolished. The house on the Palatine
was of the simplest character, with a humble portico of the local tufa
from Alba and no decorated pavements. In food and drink he was most
abstemious, and indeed the prodigious industry of his life left little
time for banquets. A slice of bread made from inferior flour, with a
relish of pickled fish or dates or olives, often served him for the day.
He never drank more than a pint of wine. He slept winter and summer in
the same room, and spent most of the year in the city, unless he was
travelling. His favourite country seat was on the island of Capri where
he could be sure of freedom. His pleasures were simple and almost
childish. He liked a little mild gambling, he was fond of playing
knuckle-bones with little slave-boys. He attended the circus<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_230" id="page_230">{230}</a></span> as a
matter of duty and was very strict in enforcing decency of behaviour
there. He set his face against changes of fashion and insisted that
Roman citizens should wear the old-fashioned toga in public. All his
instincts seem to have been for simplicity and clemency. He never
permitted a freedman to appear at his dinner-table, but when a slave of
his once pushed his master into the way of a charging wild boar in order
to shield himself Augustus dismissed the matter with a joke. On the
other hand, when the tutor and servants of Gaius showed themselves
tyrannical and overbearing to the provincials after their young master’s
death, Cæsar had them drowned like rats. Towards personal abuse of
himself he was singularly indifferent. It remains difficult to visualise
the character of Augustus. Originally he was a typical Roman, as callous
towards bloodshed and suffering as the rest of them and quite
unscrupulous in his progress towards power. But when he had attained it
he had the greatness of mind to perceive that his work of repair could
only be done by setting an example of virtuous living and moderation.
Self-control was perhaps his most powerful quality.</p>

<p>Twice his self-command broke down. Once when he heard of the defeat of
Varus in Germany with the loss of his three legions, and again when some
one, probably Livia, revealed to him the scandal concerning Julia. Apart
from the blow to his honour as a man, it was the undoing of all his
measures for reform and the open publication of their futility. “Her
orgies,” men said, “had been conducted upon the very <i>rostra</i> whence her
father’s laws against adultery had been proclaimed.” Her accomplices
included the flower of the old aristocracy, a Scipio and a Gracchus.
Augustus hid himself from the sight of men, banished his daughter to a
remote island and officially informed the senate by letter of her
disgrace. He was heard to cry out that he envied the father of Phœbe,
one of Julia’s slaves who had hanged herself when the scandal went
abroad. He quoted a Greek verse:</p>

</div>

<p>Legislation was obviously futile, and example had broken down. It was
only from within that Roman society could be reformed, only by supplying
a spiritual influence which could counteract the materialism and
immorality of the day. Augustus had tried in the provinces to raise up a
new religion of loyalty and patriotism centred round the altar “to Rome
and Augustus.” But that was obviously impossible in Rome itself. The
only inspiring motive&mdash;in addition to Stoicism which could never be a
popular creed&mdash;had been, for the last two or three centuries,
patriotism, the worship of the sacred city and her glorious destinies.
But even that had been shattered by the civil wars. Augustus now set
himself deliberately to the task of creating a new Rome and a new Roman
culture. He himself, like most of the nobles of his day, had received a
Greek education. It was what we should call a good classical education
in philosophy, literature, and rhetoric. Besides that he had been
initiated into the Eleusinian mysteries at Athens, and they were
probably the most powerful source of inspiration in the Mediterranean
world, for even eclectics like Cicero admitted that they carried with
them a hope of immortality. Augustus was himself deeply imbued with
Greek culture and like most Roman nobles had dabbled in literature. Thus
it is not surprising that the type of civilisation which he fostered in
the new Rome was quite as much Greek as Italian. The age of Augustus was
in fact the culmination of Græco-Roman culture alike in arts and letters
because the fusion between the two races was now complete.</p>

<p>Elsewhere I have ventured to rebel against the current practice in
history of subordinating the arts to politics and declaring that
artistic production depends upon political facts. It is not so. Literary
and artistic results are due to literary and artistic causes. The Roman
literary language had only just attained perfection. Cicero had
perfected it for prose, and it only remained for poetry to produce a
Vergil. Everybody<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_232" id="page_232">{232}</a></span> at Rome from Augustus downwards was busily writing
hexameters in his spare time, and the recitals which were given at every
dinner-party formed one of the social inflictions of the day. Just as
Julius Cæsar and Cicero had thrown off their epics, so the great men of
the succeeding age were poets&mdash;Augustus, Pollio, Mæcenas, Gallus, and
all of them except Agrippa. But alongside of these distinguished
amateurs, professional literary men of humble birth were now coming to
the front. Vergil and Horace are not originally the products of the
Augustan age, for they were both established poets before it began. But
the conditions of art at Rome were such that a professional man of
letters depended very closely upon a patron. That was the tradition
handed on from the days of Plautus, when the writers had nearly always
been foreign slaves or clients. Cicero, Cæsar, Lucretius, and Catullus
had not been of the client class. They had flourished in that brief
interval when it still seemed possible for Rome to develop a genuine
free literature of her own. But that possibility had been killed like so
many other hopes by the civil wars, and now the choice lay mainly
between distinguished scribblers or obsequious literary craftsmen. Thus
we get a second courtly period of literature like that of the Ptolemies
at Alexandria, like that of Louis XIV. or of our own Stuart age when
poets wrote to please individual patrons. The patron, if he be a man of
taste, generally demands a very high degree of finish, and thus it is
the courtly ages which produce the finished craftsmanship. It may be
remarked that the ages of private patronage have given the world much of
its greatest literature.</p>

<p>In the age of Augustus there was no censorship of letters such as
generally prevailed under the stricter emperors of later days. Livy was
permitted to publish his great history without curtailment of its strong
republican tendency. When libels and pasquinades appeared against Cæsar
he was content to contradict them in a proclamation. Nevertheless he
made his influence weightily felt in the world of letters. He gave more
than £10,000 to Varius for a tragedy which posterity has not<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_233" id="page_233">{233}</a></span> thought
worth while to preserve. He was himself a kindly and patient listener at
the recitation of poems and history, speeches and dialogues, which
formed the usual mode of first publication in those days. He only
insisted that his own deeds should not form the subject of trivial
composition by inferior authors. Horace appears at first to have been
warned off from treatment of imperial politics. Vergil too in his early
days received a hint not to sing of wars and kings. But later on both
these writers were explicitly enlisted in the service of the state. In
this part of the work Mæcenas was the emperor’s chief agent. Mæcenas,
whose name has come to symbolise literary patronage, was a wealthy noble
of an old Etruscan family who was content, like Cicero’s friend Atticus,
to pull the wires of state largely by keeping generous hospitality and
knowing all the important characters of his day. Luxurious and
effeminate in his tastes, he gathered a group of talented authors round
his table, and very distinctly suggested to them the lines upon which he
desired them to work. Vergil, Varius, Horace, and Propertius were
members of his salon. Another noble of high lineage, M. Valerius
Messalla, maintained a rival coterie whose most prominent member was the
elegiac poet Tibullus. Vergil, a half-Italian native of Mantua, who was
not even a citizen by birth, had sprung into fame with his <i>Bucolics</i>, a
series of pastoral idylls in the style of Theocritus. But though he was
a provincial by birth, though he writes of shepherds and sings
pathetically of his ancestral farm, nothing is more untrue than to
regard him as a son of the soil, or an inspired ploughboy after the
manner of Robert Burns. On the contrary he had received an elaborate
education in the style of the day under Greek masters at Cremona, Milan,
and Rome. He was steeped in Greek philosophy and letters. His shepherds
are not the unsophisticated rustics of the Mantuan plain. They are
shepherds “à la Watteau,” borrowed from the pages of Theocritus, and
though many a brilliant epithet displays the Italian’s loving
observation of nature, the background of the work is artificial and
literary rather than rustic or natural. His shepherds, like<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_234" id="page_234">{234}</a></span> Sidney’s,
talk politics under a transparent disguise, which is often extremely
incongruous.</p>

<p class="nind">They are often engaged in praising Gallus or Varus or
Pollio, the young poet’s patrons. It was the success of the <i>Bucolics</i>
which led Mæcenas to choose Vergil for carrying out an important
literary project. A poet was required to sing the praises of country
life in such a manner as to encourage the movement “back to the land,”
which Augustus was trying to foster. In his <i>Georgics</i> Vergil frankly
admits that he is fulfilling the “hard commands” of Mæcenas. The
<i>Georgics</i> are a treatise on husbandry, but here again it is not
first-hand work. We are informed that Vergil’s poetry had regained him
his paternal farm at Mantua. But the <i>Georgics</i> were not written on the
farm. They were diligently composed in a library at Naples. They arose
from the study of Aratus and Hesiod, not from memory of Italian life,
and even in those gorgeous passages where Vergil is praising a country
life, it is not of the Italian farm that he is thinking but of literary
hills and dells in Greece. I think it is clear that the poet took little
pleasure in his task. He very gladly digresses from the description of
soils and mattocks to tell us a charming piece of Greek mythology or to
introduce a literary reference. Octavian had been a “powerful god”
already in the Eclogues before he became Augustus. Now the only question
is which of the stars shall receive him after death. “Already the
blazing Scorpion contracts his arms and leaves thee more than a fair
share of heaven.” Vergil pauses to depict the triumph of Augustus&mdash;Nile
flowing with blood, Asia tamed, the Niphates driven back, the Parthian
conquered. No literary catchword was ever more absurd than the phrase
“rustic of genius” applied to Vergil. As soon as he had the means, he
gladly turned his back upon his ancestral farm to become a student and a
courtier. Nevertheless Mæcenas was magnificently served. Vergil had
already forged a weapon of matchless music and eloquence in his surging
hexameters, and he used it to depict the honest joys of rustic toil, the
laborious tranquillity of the farm, the beauty and interest of nature.
He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_235" id="page_235">{235}</a></span> instantly recognised by Augustus as the destined laureate of the
new Rome.</p>

<p>The <i>Æneid</i> was solemnly devoted to the altar of Rome and Augustus.
Homer was the Greek model here, as Theocritus had been for the
<i>Bucolics</i> and Hesiod for the <i>Georgics</i>. The origin of Rome was to be
linked on to the Trojan story as had already been done by the inventive
Greeks. Æneas had fled from Troy to Italy, and had left his son Julus
(the eponymous hero of the Julian house) to found an heroic kingdom in
Italy long before the genuine Roman heroes. Thus the humble native story
of Romulus was superseded. Piety was to be the great virtue honoured by
this poem, for piety towards the memory of Julius Cæsar was the
principal title upon which Augustus rested his claim to honour. There
were other analogies, perhaps. Dido most probably suggested Cleopatra to
the Roman reader. But it is to the praise of Rome, to the glorification
of that sense of filial duty which the Romans called “piety” that the
great epic is mainly devoted. Here again, though the eloquence is so
splendid and the versification so majestic, the <i>Æneid</i> like its
predecessors is a work of the study quite clearly written to order. The
plot is carelessly constructed. Æneas himself, with all his piety, never
for a moment lives. The religious motives which led to his desertion of
Dido barely satisfy us. Æneas makes the speeches, and the gods
continually intervene when danger threatens him. Our sympathies are
generally with the enemy, with Turnus or Camilla. Æneas is as chilly and
statuesque as Augustus himself.</p>

<p>It is in the famous Sixth Book, which tells of the descent to Hades,
that the praise of Rome is most elegant and most explicit. Here we are
shown the heroes of Roman history side by side with the heroes of the
Greeks, and here the young Marcellus, lately dead, is introduced in
those immortal and touching lines which caused Octavia his mother to
swoon when the poet recited them. Here too the poet pronounces in very
significant language the Roman idea of the destiny of his race.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_236" id="page_236">{236}</a></span></p>

<p class="nind">“Others shall mould, I doubt not, the breathing bronze more delicately
and draw the living features out of marble, others shall plead causes
more eloquently, map out the wanderings of the sky with the rod, and
tell the risings of the stars. Thou, Roman, forget not to govern the
nations under thy sway. These shall be thy arts: to impose the rule of
peace, to spare the subject, and defeat the proud.” In these lines we
hear the proud Philistinism of an imperial people. This is the genuine
Roman (dare I add “British”?) attitude towards the arts and sciences.
They are for others to provide, for Greeks and Egyptians. Even oratory,
the highest achievement of the Roman genius in literature, is thus
scornfully thrown to the foreigner. The Romans knew that they could buy
or seize better statues than they could carve: their task was to conquer
and govern&mdash;not an ignoble art.</p>

<p>The <i>Æneid</i> is explicitly a national laureate poem. The poet seeks to
enshrine all Roman life in his pages, to epitomise Roman history and to
introduce allusions to characteristic pieces of myth and ritual. He
inserts whole lines of Ennius or Lucretius when they please him. They
are superseded and replaced. Just like Dryden, he feels that he is the
heir of the ages. The extraordinary popularity which Vergil attained
even in his own lifetime grew in the course of a few centuries almost
into a cult. His tomb became an object of pilgrimage; in early Christian
times he became a prophet and in the Middle Ages a wizard. The
gentleness and purity of his personal life played their part in the
creation of this strange Vergilian legend.</p>

<p>Horace had less of the courtier’s suppleness and required winning to the
imperial cause. It took two efforts of Mæcenas<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_237" id="page_237">{237}</a></span> to secure him and we
have letters preserved in which Augustus very good-humouredly confesses
his disappointment that Horace has refused a secretaryship. Horace was
the son of a freedman, as he was not in the least ashamed to confess.
But his father had managed to secure for Quintus the education of a
gentleman under Greek teachers in Rome, himself attending the boy to
school in place of the rascally pedagogue slaves who usually undertook
that office. Horace had further enjoyed a University education at
Athens, where he had fallen under the spell of Brutus, for whom he
fought at Philippi. He was, and remained, a Republican by instinct, but
Mæcenas won him over to the cause of Cæsarism. He made his reputation
with the <i>Satires</i>, a species of composition which may be termed truly
Italian. The satire is a conversational medley written in the language
of prose with the rhythm of poetry. In this Horace was imitating the old
Roman master Lucilius. It is much to the credit of his critical
discernment that Mæcenas was able to descry the brilliant abilities of
Horace in this very uninspiring medium. For though his <i>Satires</i> were
sometimes bitterly satirical in the modern sense of the word, Horace’s
chief literary asset was the charm of a sunny, genial character. He had
in addition a gift for composition and an industry which brought him
almost but not quite to the level of original genius. It seems to have
been Mæcenas who set him to the writing of lyrical odes. Biting satires
might have been the most effective literary weapon in republican days,
but the glorification of the new regime required something of a loftier
strain. Vergil was engaged upon its epic, Horace was instructed to write
its occasional verse. The Greek lyrists of the older period had as yet
remained unimitated in Latin. Accordingly just as when the young Vergil
had wanted to sing of kings and battles “Apollo had plucked his ear and
admonished him that a shepherd should feed fat sheep and sing a slender
song,” so Horace was deliberately set down to the task of celebrating
the new Rome in the style of Sappho and Alcæus and Anacreon. That he
accomplished his task so superbly is a proof of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_238" id="page_238">{238}</a></span> energy and
versatility. He himself, a gentle valetudinarian whose idea of a banquet
was a mess of cabbage and pot-herbs, had to strike the lyre of revelry
and sing of wine and love. He sang without conviction, without a spark
of Sapphic fire or a note of natural music, but the noble rhetoric of
the Roman schools in the golden age supported him. He laboured for the
right word never in vain. No writer has ever equalled his matchless gift
for making truisms sound true. No other writer has been able to assert
that “it is sweet and comely to die for the fatherland,” or that “life
is short” with an equal air of genuine wisdom. Latin with its terse
precision is the ideal language for the expression of platitudes. His
patriotic eloquence is Roman rhetoric of the best kind. But perhaps his
real strength lies in drama. It is strange that Latin of the classical
period failed at producing a native drama so completely as it did.
Perhaps it was because the writers of that age were so completely under
Greek influences that their natural Italian genius for the theatre was
stifled under the load of a classical convention. Certainly Horace had
the gift, and in such passages as the dramatic duologue (Ode ix. of Book
III.) <i>Donec gratus eram tibi</i>, or the Epode of the witches (v.) <i>At, o
deorum</i>, or the still more famous Epistle about the bore, he exhibits
himself, like Browning, as a dramatist gone astray. Regarded from the
purely lyrical point of view, the Century Hymn, which he wrote to order
as Rome’s laureate in succession to Vergil, is perhaps his greatest
achievement. The Secular Games of 17 <small>B.C.</small> were intended to bring visibly
before men’s eyes the glories of the new monarchy and incidentally to
carry in their train the salutary but unpopular measures of the Julian
moral reform. So the choir of noble youths and maidens were taught to
sing in their prayer to Diana:</p>

<p class="nind">where the goddess is besought to increase the population of Rome and
favour the <i>senate’s</i> decrees about marriage. The fourth book of the
<i>Odes</i> was added after a long interval at the direct request of
Augustus. It is intended to bring the achievements of Augustus and his
family, particularly the triumphs of Tiberius and Drusus, into
favourable comparison with the heroic stories of republican history. It
is most melancholy to observe that Mæcenas, to whom Horace was genuinely
attached and whose name constantly occurs in his earlier writings, here
drops out of the poet’s verse because he had fallen out of Cæsar’s
favour.</p>

<p>Although Horace is in his <i>Odes</i> as classical and conventional as all
the Roman writers of his age, his <i>Satires</i> and <i>Epistles</i> are more
intimate than any other Latin work of the great period. In them we get
real glimpses of life at Rome, or on a country estate. We cannot fail to
be struck with its idleness and emptiness. In the city he saunters from
the forum to the baths, from the baths to the dinner-table with time and
boredom for his only enemies. In the country he sometimes, it is true,
toys with husbandry, or shows a faint interest in landscape-gardening or
loiters among his books, but the life is to the last degree
super-civilised and unreal. The very ideas of hope and progress were
alien to the ancient world. The eyes of the Romans were always turned
behind them, so that they could not see the greatness of the vista that
was now opening for them in front.</p>

<p>The elegists&mdash;such as the graceful melancholy Tibullus, or Propertius,
the pedant who often stumbled into poetry, and a host of others who are
mere names to us&mdash;would hardly, but for their prominence in the
schoolroom, deserve serious attention. Callimachus the Alexandrian was
their model, himself scarcely a first-rate poet. The whole idea of
writing love poetry in an absolutely regular distich of hexameter and
pentameter was inartistic and unreal. Their fluent prolixity makes them
insufferably tedious out of school. It is difficult to sustain interest
in the relations between the bards and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_240" id="page_240">{240}</a></span> married ladies with Greek
pseudonyms to whom their verses are addressed. From our point of view
the chief interest in these writers lies in the fact that nearly all of
them were at one time or another invited to praise the new regime.
Tibullus, indeed, who enjoyed a modest competence of his own, limits his
praises to his immediate patron Messalla, and frankly admits that war
and battles disgust him. But Propertius makes an attempt to carry out
his commission, and describes the battle of Actium fifteen years after
its occurrence. But though he invites Bacchus to assist his Muse, it is
wretched stuff and the poet himself turns from it with disgust. The
famous elegy upon Cornelia, daughter of the injured Scribonia, beginning
<i>desine, Paulle, meum lacrimis urgere sepulcrum</i>, is however sufficient
proof that it was only the want of a really inspiring theme and a
suitable medium which prevented Propertius from being in the front rank
of the world’s poets.</p>

<p>Ovid, “this incorrigibly immoral but inexpressibly graceful poet,” as
Mr. Cruttwell called him, is a far more interesting personality. I think
he may fairly be called the wickedest writer on the world’s bookshelves.
Others may be wicked through ignorance, or by accident, or out of high
animal spirits, but Ovid is immoral on principle, a conscientious and
industrious perverter. His greatest work, “The Art of Loving,” is quite
frankly a guide to adultery, the precepts it contains being perfectly
practical and evidently based on expert knowledge. In his <i>Amores</i>,
<i>Metamorphoses</i>, and <i>Fasti</i> he took for his field the domain of
religion and exhibited celestial sin in the most captivating light. We
have already seen how the loves of the gods came to take their place in
the Olympian mythology, and how thinking pagans like Plato regarded
them. To such men they were already relics of barbarism, but Ovid draws
them out into the light again, gilds them with his wit and makes them
altogether charming for the Roman drawing-room. The strange and uncouth
old ritual of Italian nature-worship is piquantly dressed out for the
up-to-date blasphemer. Nobody who had read Ovid could possibly worship
Jupiter any</p>

<p class="nind">more. It was all done with consummate art and unblushing impudence. When
the sad Niobe is bereft of her seven fair children by the arrows of the
jealous gods, our poet, ingeniously parodying Vergil, observes:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">heu quantum hæc Niobe, Niobe distabat ab illa.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">In telling the dreadful tragedy whereby the Greeks had explained the
sorrow of Philomela, the nightingale, our poet cheerfully describes the
slaughter of the children, adding:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">pars inde cauis exultat aënis,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">pars ueribus stridunt.<br /></span>

</div>

<p class="nind">And so he moves from one lovely myth to another, preserving them indeed
for our archæologists, but delicately with the breath of his profanity
defiling them for ever.</p>

<p>Now Ovid is far more typical of the civilisation of his day than either
Vergil or Horace. For Ovid was a Roman noble, rich and gifted, who in
earlier days would have passed creditably from one high office to
another in the state, humorously plundering a province or two,
gracefully collecting objects of art in Asia and possibly losing a
battle or two through negligence. He actually started on a public career
as a brilliant barrister, and enjoyed the ancient office of <i>decemvir</i>
stlitibus iudicandis, something like our Masters in Chancery. But the
Roman drawing-rooms soon swallowed him up in their silken entanglements,
and he spent the greater part of his life whispering his poisonous
little pentameters to ladies like Julia. Of course a single poet with
Ovid’s sinister gifts was doing far more to corrupt Rome than all the
Julian legislation could do to reform it, and we may fairly conclude
that Ovid with his attacks on the traditional Roman morality and
religion, together with effeminate bards like Tibullus who sang of the
horrors of war, were more than undoing the patriotic work of Vergil and
Horace. The plain fact is that though you may hire writers you cannot
purchase the spirit of a people, and so Augustus and Mæcenas found, to
the great misfortune of the Roman Empire. They failed in their attempt
to capture literature.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_242" id="page_242">{242}</a></span> Oppression failed even more signally than
corruption. Henceforth all the literary talent of Rome is on the
opposition side. Lucan extols republicanism, Tacitus assails the
emperors with satirical history, Petronius pillories Nero with satirical
romance, Juvenal with satirical poetry. Only the younger Pliny is loyal,
and to be praised by Pliny is a very doubtful recommendation. Roman
literature had imbibed the republican ideals from its Greek
foster-mother. The schoolmasters of Rome continued to teach their pupils
to declaim against tyrants.</p>

<p>But Ovid himself was not permitted to flourish in his wickedness. A
sudden decree from Cæsar Augustus fell upon him like a thunderbolt. He
was banished for ever and bidden to betake himself to Tomi, on the Black
Sea, near the mouth of the Danube. From that inhospitable region he
continued to pour forth elegiacs, <i>Epistles</i> and <i>Tristia</i>, wherein he
protests his innocence, recants anything and everything he has ever
said, and bewails the horrors of arctic existence among the barbarians.
The actual cause of his banishment is one of the most piquant mysteries
in literary history. He has <i>seen</i> something which he ought not to have
seen: his eyes have destroyed him. It is fairly clear that his
banishment synchronised with the banishment of the younger Julia, and we
may well believe that the old emperor, shocked and horrified by this
second scandal in his own house, attributed it to the corrupting
influence of that singer of gilded sins. The banishment was certainly
well merited and the only pity is that it came too late to effect its
purpose. The unmanly tone of the <i>Tristia</i>, the effeminate appeals to
everybody in Rome including a hitherto forgotten wife, reveal Ovid in
his true character. It is a little strange that generations of British
youth have been trained not only in the study but even in the imitation
of this author.</p>

<p>When we term the Golden Age of Roman literature “Augustan” we ought to
remember that it began long before Augustus and ended before his death.
Thus with all his patronage he may more justly be called the finisher
than the author of it. Of all the great writers, only Ovid, to whom the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_243" id="page_243">{243}</a></span>
simple life and bracing air of the Sarmatians afforded an unusual
longevity, outlived Augustus. Summing up the characteristics of the
literature of this day, we may say that courtliness and artificiality
were its most prominent characteristics. The freshness of Catullus, the
stern conviction of Lucretius, the fire of Cicero were extinct. Nearly
all that was native in Roman letters had perished; only the crispness of
epigram, the bite of satire and the dignified music of the language
itself remained as the Italian heritage. Greece had quite definitely
triumphed over Rome. Technical excellence continued, for this has always
been the mark of “Augustan” periods. But the well-meant efforts of the
state to capture literature for its own service had failed. The horrors
of the civil war outweighed the glories of the new regime and with all
his benevolence the emperor could never outlive the memory of his
proscriptions. Literature never forgave the murder of Cicero though the
author of <i>Thyestes</i> might be loaded with treasure. Indeed the
widespread misery of those terrible days in 40 <small>B.C</small>. came home personally
to most of our middle-class writers. Vergil, Horace, Tibullus, and
Propertius had each and all received ineffaceable memories in the loss
of their patrimonies. It was little wonder that even though they sang of
wars and victories when “Cynthius plucked their ear” their natural
instinct was to compare Mars and Venus very much to the disadvantage of
the former.</p>

<p>When we turn to consider the Art of the period, we must not forget to
carry with us the light that we have obtained from the study of its
literature. For Augustus and his assistants were attempting precisely
similar ends in both regions. With temples, baths, circuses,
amphitheatres, colonnades, libraries, and statues the new regime was to
flourish its magnificence in the eyes of the world and, above all, to
dazzle the citizens of Rome, fill up the emptiness of their lives, and
make them forget, if it were possible, the magnitude of their loss.
Money was lavished upon this object by the emperor and all his friends,
and the building activity which transformed Rome<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_244" id="page_244">{244}</a></span> from a city of brick
into a city of marble must have given work and pay to vast numbers of
the poor. But the magnificence has all perished, as all magnificence
must, and it is left for us by the study of a few ruined monuments, a
few statues and busts, an altar here, a cornice there, to estimate the
spirit of Rome in conformity with its literature.</p>

<p>Roman art supplied much of their inspiration to the artists of the
Renaissance. Michael Angelo and Raphael learnt their art by copying the
antiquities, and much of the Renaissance architecture was direct
imitation of the Augustan age. But with the birth of archæology as a
science in the nineteenth century, scholars became accustomed to leap
straight over the Roman era, or to regard it merely as a phase of the
Hellenistic decline. From that view, undoubtedly erroneous and unjust,
there has latterly been an attempt to escape. Wickhoff and Riegl, whose
foremost interpreter in this country is Mrs. Strong, have argued that
Roman art has an existence <i>per se</i>, not only possessing characteristic
excellences of its own, but in many points transcending the limits of
Greek art. To such pioneers we owe a deep debt of gratitude. They have
undoubtedly drawn our attention to real merits and real steps of
progress in the art of the Romans. But on the whole they have failed, as
it seems to an onlooker, to prove their case. Partly it is in the long
run a question of taste. A convinced Romanist like Mrs. Strong displays
for our admiration many works of art which trained eyes, accustomed to
Greek and modern art, often refuse to admire. I would take as an
instance the well-known “Tellus Group,” a slab from the Augustan Altar
of Peace,<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> preserved in the Uffizi Gallery at Florence. To me it
seems a laborious composition, executed with care and skill, but wholly
without inspiration or imagination. It is purely conventional allegory.
How would the designer of an illuminated ticket for an agricultural
exhibition depict Mother Earth? He would design a group (would he not?)
with a tall and richly bosomed lady for his central figure, he would
put</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_245" id="page_245">{245}</a></span> two naked babes upon her lap, at her feet would be a cow and a
sheep, while the background would be filled with flowers and trees. The
cornucopia would occupy a prominent position. If he were asked to fill
his space with additional figures, he would throw in Air and Water, one
on each side, designed on the same plan. There would be little motive in
the group, little connection between the figures. The designer’s aim
would be that the spectator in a casual glance might observe the fitness
of it all&mdash;Earth sitting between Air and Water&mdash;note it, and pass on.
This is just what the Roman artist has done. He has earned his money. He
has carved most skilfully and diligently, he has introduced all the
conventional emblems. He has drawn his metaphor from stock. I cannot see
that he has put any love or religion or indeed faith of any kind into
his work. The only thing my eye cares to dwell upon is the absurdity of
Air, who is riding (backwards) on a wholly inadequate swan, pretending
to form one of a group with the immovably seated Earth. This then is the
first point of criticism against the Romanists. I have put it as a mere
subjective impression, which involves simply a question of taste. But in
reality it is more. They are failing or have failed to make out their
case, chiefly because the critical world of art-lovers declines to
follow their expressions of enthusiasm, and can give reasons for its
refusal.</p>

<p>Secondly, we have a right to ask the apostles of Roman art what they
mean by their claims. How justly may we call works like the Altar of
Peace,<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> or even the Column of Trajan, “Roman Art”? Was any of it
executed by Roman artists? We have just read the true Roman attitude
towards art in Vergil’s scornful <i>excudent alii</i>. We may be sure that
the Altar of Peace was executed by Greeks. The only named sculptors of
the period are Greeks. This is indeed admitted, but then the Roman claim
takes one of two forms, (1) that work executed in the Roman Empire may
be called Roman, which is absurd, or (2) that apart from mere execution
there<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_246" id="page_246">{246}</a></span> are in the work certain characteristic innovations which are due
to Roman inspiration. The latter claim is true, to some extent, and
important.</p>

<p>Just as Mæcenas “plucked the ear” of the poets, and instructed them when
to sing or when to refrain from singing of kings and battles, so the
patron of art gave instructions to the Greek artists. It is clear enough
what instructions he gave. Like Cromwell he cried “Paint me as I am,
warts and all. Leave your idealism, your perfect profiles, your serene
gods in the tranquillity of Olympus, and depict men with the living
emotions displayed in frown and wrinkle.” That was excellent advice, no
doubt, but he seems to have gone further. He seems, like the good Dr.
Primrose, to have demanded value for his money by insisting upon so many
portraits to the square yard of surface to be decorated. Is not this the
explanation of the crowded figures in the new style of relief work, as
exhibited at Rome from the Altar of Peace to the Column of Trajan? In
the friezes of the Mausoleum, the fourth-century Greek sculptors had
discovered the advantage of free spacing so that each figure has a value
of its own. The florid taste of the millionaire Attalids of Pergamum had
made a reactionary movement in the direction of crowded and tangled
forms. Now these Roman friezes carry the demand a stage further. In
these processions we have a compact mass of faces, each admirably and no
doubt faithfully portrayed, but ruining by their very numbers the
artistic success of the whole. The spectator is not to admire a
composition. As in Frith’s “Derby Day” he is to pick out a face here and
there and cry “That is Agrippa: that is Messalla: that is Germanicus.”
In its essence such a demand is not the mark of a people with any sense
of art. On the contrary it is the measure of their crudity and
Philistinism. Nevertheless this new demand enabled the versatile Greek
genius to win for itself fresh triumphs, especially in realistic
portraiture and narrative relief-work.</p>

<p>Part of the claim which Wickhoff and his followers make for the
originality of Roman art is based upon the belief that<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_247" id="page_247">{247}</a></span> the limitations
of Greek art are not self-imposed; for example, that the Greeks did not
know how to express emotion in the plastic arts, that they could not
make realistic portraits, that through ignorance they never perceived
the beauty of a stark corpse, that Pheidias lacked the intelligence to
find a dramatic centre for the Parthenon frieze, and so forth. Such
assumptions as these are easily disproved. Greeks were capable of
realism (witness the Ludovisi reliefs<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>) but they preferred to
idealise. In portraying giants, barbarians, or slaves they could express
transient emotions, but for Greeks and gods in statuary they
deliberately preferred serenity. The Greeks sought to conceal their art
rather than to display it, as we have learnt from the discovery of the
subtle secrets of their architecture, and it is rash to assert of any
principle of craftsmanship that the Greeks did not know it. Many of the
claims of Rome to originality may be refuted by this consideration.</p>

<p>What I believe to be the true statement of the case is this: Greek art
did not come to an end with the death of Praxiteles or the Roman
conquest. Its central impulse passed over from the impoverished mainland
to the still flourishing communities of the East, to Antioch on the
Mæander where the Aphrodite of Melos was produced, to Rhodes where the
Laocoön was carved, to Ephesus, and farther east still, even into
Parthia and possibly India. It was by no means stereotyped but still
producing new forms to meet fresh demands, as for sarcophagi in Sidon,
or for paintings and mosaics in Egypt. In the course of this period the
art of the Greeks was much influenced by the East. The Romans at first
were content to take Greek art as they found it. In the days of Mummius
they were merely like rich transatlantic collectors in search of
beautiful, still more of precious and unique, commodities. They had no
doubt some slaves of their own working in Rome at the arts and crafts.
Some of these would be Greeks of inferior birth and capacity reproducing
old Greek work for the Roman market. But some of them may well have
been<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_248" id="page_248">{248}</a></span> Italians, some Etruscans preserving the old artistic traditions of
their race. This “collecting” era lasted down to the time of Augustus.
We have seen it as late as Cicero and Atticus. There was little demand
for new creations in those days. Few temples were being built. The
artists were still scattered about the Levant. There was little to
attract them to Rome.</p>

<p>But when Augustus decided to build a new Rome of marble, founding or
restoring his eighty temples, with arches and theatres innumerable all
over the Empire, there must have been a great influx of artists from
Greece and Asia Minor. Now begins an art to which we may fairly apply
the term Græco-Roman in the sense that it was the work of Greek artists
under oriental influences supplying Roman demands. The new demands
entailed still further artistic developments; some of them, but not all,
to be regarded by those who view the history of art as a whole, as
improvements. One main effect of Roman conditions was that art largely
ceased its service of religion and became devoted to secular purposes.
Thus the limitations of the best Greek art, self-imposed as they were,
now broke down. The effect is seen especially in portraiture, where the
Romans had a tradition of realism resulting from the use of the
death-mask in making wax images of the illustrious deceased. Hence in
the decoration of the great Altar of Peace at Rome, the Greek artists,
who would naturally have produced a frieze of gods or idealised
worshippers, were asked for portraits of the men of the day. I think it
is clear that enormous skill was devoted to the likenesses of men and
very little care to the gods. The composition of the whole was of little
account. A little later the demand for historical reliefs on arches and
columns was met by the development of quite new features in the art of
sculpture, namely, those spatial or tridimensional effects of
perspective which are so remarkable on the Trajan column.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> This art
seems to have begun in Alexandrian times but Rome may claim the credit
for its development. It was necessary, if sculpture was to do that<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_249" id="page_249">{249}</a></span> for

<p class="nind">which it was surely never intended&mdash;to tell a story. The Parthenon
frieze was religious ornament, the Trajan column is secular history.
When the Romans required ornament they were content with decoration
merely and the artists complied with the wonderful skill which they had
probably learnt in Asia. Never have there been such exquisite natural
designs in wreaths and festoons of flowers and fruit as in the sculpture
of the Augustan age.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> It is the same with the art of the goldsmith,
as we see in the wonderful discoveries of silver made at Hildesheim and
Bosco Reale<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> or in the great imperial cameos wrought in sardonyx.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
There was money and skill in plenty. But what was lacking was a spirit
to animate it.</p>

<p>If we could be sure of our ground in setting down realism as the Roman
contribution to the history of Art, it would be a great achievement for
Rome. Realism is undoubtedly a fine thing though idealism is a finer.
Unfortunately it seems that Hellenic art in the eastern centres was
developing realism, or at least illusionism, for itself on its own soil.
On the whole, in the controversy between the archæologists, Strzygowski,
who claims the East as the inspiring force in Roman days, seems to have
the best of it. The coins of Asia Minor present realistic portraiture
quite distinct from that which was native on Roman soil. Thus the
exquisite festoons of flowers, fruit, and birds, all botanically and
anatomically correct to the last feather or stamen, are probably the
product of Greece and the East. But we may well believe that the nature
of the Roman patron’s demands assisted this movement. The Roman, if we
may judge by Pliny the Roman art-critic, was just the man to insist that
an apple should not resemble a pear or to count the petals of a poppy.
This sort of criticism affords excellent discipline for the artist. The
statues of the period, such as the Venus Genetrix by Arcesilaus in the
Louvre<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> and the Orestes and Electra group by Stephanus at Naples, are
not very interesting works. They are plainly late-born issues of Greek
sculpture, though in the latter there<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_250" id="page_250">{250}</a></span> is an attempt at expression which
seems to be derived from the influence of portraiture. The “Electra,”
for example, has the same look in her eyes, a frowning look as of one
standing in strong sunlight, that we see in the portrait of Agrippa.
Portraiture had taught the sculptor of this day new secrets about the
setting of the human eye. They had learnt the effect produced by
deepening the hollow under the brow and by making the direction of the
glance diverge from that of the head and body. But much of this was a
legacy from Scopas. In little things like the hang of Electra’s robe
there is visible degeneration. Here, as in the Tellus Group, the contour
of the bosom is made to support the falling drapery, an unnatural and
very unpleasing effect.</p>

<p>The architecture of the period is distinguished by similar
characteristics. It is distinctly Græco-Roman with much of the subtle
harmony of fine Greek work lost. The temples are, on the whole, the
least interesting part of the work, for they are pale copies of Greek
architecture not always very artistically adapted. A good many of the
ruined monuments of Rome to which the pious traveller now directs his
footsteps date from the Augustan period. Many of the temples of the
Republic were now rebuilt on the old plan with more sumptuous materials,
as, for example, the round shrine of Mater Matuta,<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> commonly called
the Temple of Hercules. Technical innovations include the debasement of
the Doric column by omitting those subtle flutings which gave it all the
grace whereby its strength was saved from clumsiness, and by erecting it
upon a pedestal. But the Romans preferred the more exuberant Corinthian
order with its florid capital of acanthus foliage, a type which the
Greeks had used very sparingly and seldom externally. Again, the Romans
had discovered improved methods of construction which enabled them to
use a wider span in roofing, but they made no artistic advantage out of
this fact. On the contrary, by dispensing with the <i>peristyle</i> or
surrounding colonnade they rendered the exterior of their temples much
less interesting.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_251" id="page_251">{251}</a></span></p>

<p class="nind">The principal surviving relics of Augustan temples
are eight columns of the Temple of Saturn<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> which still stand in the
Forum at Rome. The celebrated Pantheon<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> is now recognised to be a
work of Hadrian’s time though its plan probably repeats that of the
temple erected on the site by Agrippa. But the clearest picture of the
ecclesiastical architecture of the day is to be seen on the reliefs of
the Altar of Peace, which reproduce the appearance of actual temples
with almost photographic exactitude. The finest extant example is
undoubtedly the temple at Nismes, known as the Maison Carrée,<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> a
graceful erection of this period which exhibits the Corinthian style
without undue extravagance.</p>

<p>As the Romans of this day had scarcely any trace of genuine religious
feeling it is not surprising that they had little of their own to
contribute to temple architecture except wealth and magnificence. But
they were naturally devoted to building and that was the favourite
extravagance of the rich. Nothing but a few pavements survives of all
the handsome villas which dotted the hill-sides at Tibur and Præneste,
or lined the coast at Baiæ, Naples, and Surrentum. But there are several
secular buildings of Augustan date in which we can see a handsome
Græco-Roman style of architecture wherein Greek columns and entablatures
were used by Roman architects chiefly as ornament. The Theatre of
Marcellus,<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> built in 13 <small>B.C.</small>, still presents considerable remains,
which though much defaced exhibit an appearance of bygone splendour. The
lower story is Doric, the second is Ionic, and the third which has
perished was probably in the Corinthian style. We may judge its
effective appearance from the copy of its elevation which Michael Angelo
produced in his design for the inner court of the Farnese Palace at
Rome.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> The Renaissance learnt much of its architecture from Augustan
Rome and these very designs may be seen springing up around us to-day in
the banks and town-halls of London. Thus Augustan Rome holds a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_252" id="page_252">{252}</a></span>
supremacy for secular building even greater than Periclean Athens
achieved for temples. Where magnificence and solidity&mdash;and it may be
added cheapness&mdash;are the principal motives of construction, the
Græco-Roman style of the First Century <small>B.C.</small> is unmatched.</p>

<p>The most gorgeous of the architectural creations of Augustus was,
however, that Temple of Mars the Avenger which he set up in memory of
his triumph over Antony and his punishment of the conspirators. Round it
was a piazza (forum) adorned with imaginary portrait statues of all the
Roman heroes of history with biographical inscriptions on the bases. In
all the Augustan culture we see the impress of the prince’s own
Græco-Roman taste. It was all planned to achieve his object of dazzling
the multitude and yet gaining over to his side the highest intellect and
taste of his day. His own tastes were refined and fastidious: he hated
extravagance and utility was always before his eyes. “He read the
classics in both tongues” says Suetonius, “principally in order to find
salutary precepts and examples for public and private life. He would
copy these out word for word and send them to his servants or to the
governors of armies and provinces or to the magistrates of the city
whenever they required his admonitions. He used to read whole volumes to
the Senate, and often publish them in an edict.” We learn further that
he always prepared his more important orations most carefully, writing
them down and keeping the manuscript close at hand. This practice he
followed even in his discourse with his wife. Augustan culture has just
this quality: it takes immense pains and succeeds by virtue of them. It
lacks a good deal in spontaneity but it makes up in excellence of
technique.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_253" id="page_253">{253}</a></span></p>

/></span>N these words, pregnant and terse as ever, Tacitus gives us a key to
the true reading of imperial Roman history. “It is easy,” he says, “to
discount the self-interest of the historian and to reject his eulogies,
but his malicious criticisms are greedily swallowed. For flattery bears
the odious stamp of servility, while malignity wears the false disguise
of independence.” Thus out of his own mouth the foremost historian of
the early Empire gives us the right to read the literary sources in a
spirit favourable to the emperors. So when the historians describe
Tiberius as a bloodthirsty tyrant who hid himself away in the island of
Capri, and there (at the age of seventy!) began to devote himself to
disgusting orgies of lust and cruelty, we shall prefer to reject that
story as absurd, and to regard Tiberius as a proud and reserved
aristocrat who found it impossible to tolerate the mixture of adulation
and spite with which he was treated by the other nobles of Rome, and
withdrew from the capital in order to escape it. When Gaius (Caligula)
is represented as a lunatic, we merely understand that he was unpopular;
when we are told that he made his horse a consul, we recognise a
satirist’s humorous exaggeration of his neglect of some noble family’s
claims to that office;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_254" id="page_254">{254}</a></span> when we read that he set his army to collect
oyster shells on the coast of Normandy, we only conclude that his
surrender of the projected invasion of Britain was a subject of ridicule
in Rome. Claudius is described as a stupid and clumsy pedant, deformed
and inarticulate: in reality he seems to have been a scholar with a
leaning towards antiquarian and republican traditions. Even in the case
of Nero, the savage ferocity with which he is charged is chiefly due to
the fact that his hand lay heavy on the senators. He was undoubtedly
popular with the commons, and his real offence was to possess more
refinement and culture than was considered proper in a Roman noble, to
be too fond of Greeks and art and music. Nevertheless it is impossible
to write history in whitewash, and the only safe method of dealing with
a period like this is to ignore the personalities on the throne of the
Cæsars, and to attempt a broad treatment of the general tendency of
these times.</p>

<p>But by neglecting the gossip and the personalities we do, I fear, run
the risk of missing much of the interest of the period, and perhaps we
lose an important part of the truth. We must not allow ourselves to be
wholly deprived of that impression of purple and splendour which hangs
about the Golden House of Nero, nor to forget the taint of crime which
clings to the palaces of the Cæsars. The latter in particular is an
essential part of imperial history. As we have seen, this Empire founded
on compromise was and remained illegitimate. The succession was always
open to question; there was no law of heredity. This fact was emphasised
by the barrenness of the Roman aristocracy. For a hundred years no
prince had a son to succeed him, so that the palace was always full of
intrigue. Finally, the wickedness of the women is one of the most
sinister features of the time. Though it was, indeed, no innovation of
the Empire, it now gains a terrible significance in the dynastic
conflicts which surrounded the throne. Every one of the early reigns is
stained with murders and fearful <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_255" id="page_255">{255}</a></span>crimes in the palace. No doubt much of
this history is false and malicious. For example, it is by no means
likely that Germanicus was poisoned. There were always scandal-mongers
to hint at poison when any member of the ruling house died of disease.
But even with the most liberal discount for exaggeration, the record is
a black one. Let us select two typical stories, in order to suggest the
kind of satanic halo which surrounds the imperial houses, as the ancient
historians depict them.</p>

TWO VIEWS OF THE AQUEDUCT OF CLAUDIUS</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Claudius, the conqueror of Britain, was in reality the ablest and best
of the Claudian Cæsars who succeeded Augustus, but his wife Messalina,
thirty-four years his junior, was a creature of shameless lust and
remorseless cruelty. Valerius Asiaticus, a Gaul by birth but now the
richest noble of his day, was in possession of the far-famed gardens of
Lucullus. Messalina coveted the park and accused him to her husband,
with the inevitable result. Asiaticus died like a gentleman. He took his
usual exercise, he bathed and dined quite cheerfully, and then he opened
his veins, “but not until he had inspected his funeral pyre and ordered
its removal to another place, for fear that the smoke should injure the
thick foliage of the trees.” So died this lover of gardens. Messalina’s
sins grew more open, until at last she went through a public pantomime
of marriage with one of her paramours, Silius, a consul-elect. The
ceremony was performed before a number of witnesses duly invited.
Claudius was at that time guided by the counsels of three Greek
secretaries, and one of them determined to reveal the shameful truth to
the emperor. Tacitus tells the story of her ruin in graphic language.
She was celebrating the vintage feast in the gardens she had wickedly
gained for herself. The presses were being trodden, the vats were
overflowing, women girt with skins were dancing, as Bacchanals dance in
their worship or their frenzy. Messalina with flowing hair shook the
thyrsus, and Silius, at her side, crowned with ivy and wearing the
buskin, moved his head in time with some lascivious chorus. One of the
guests had climbed a tree in sport and reported a “hurricane from
Ostia.” It was truer than he knew,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_256" id="page_256">{256}</a></span> for just then messengers began to
arrive with news that Claudius was on his way from Ostia, coming with
vengeance. The revels ceased, the revellers fled in all directions, and
Messalina, left deserted, mounted a garden cart to proceed along the
road to meet her husband. Her appeal failed, though Claudius would
undoubtedly have relented but for the interference of the freedman
Narcissus. After dinner, warmed with the wine, he bade some one go and
tell “that poor creature” to come before him on the morrow to plead her
cause. But Narcissus had already sent soldiers to her, and she was
driven to suicide. “Claudius was still at the banquet when they told him
that Messalina was dead, without mentioning whether it was by her own or
another’s hand. Nor did he ask the question, but called for his cup and
finished the repast as usual.”</p>

<p>Nero, too, in the pages of Suetonius appears so incredible in his
wickedness that the exaggeration is obvious. Of his splendid new palace
the Golden House we read: “The portico was so high that it could contain
a colossal statue of himself a hundred and twenty feet in height; and
the space it included was so vast that it had a triple colonnade, a mile
in length, and a lake like a sea, surrounded with buildings that looked
like a city. It had a park with cornfields, vineyards, pastures, and
woods containing a vast number of animals of all kinds, wild and tame.
Parts of it were entirely overlaid with gold, and incrusted with jewels
and pearl. The supper-rooms were vaulted and the compartments of the
ceilings, which were inlaid with ivory, were made to revolve and scatter
flowers. They also contained pipes to shed scents upon the guests. The
chief banqueting-room was circular and revolved perpetually day and
night, according to the motion of the celestial bodies. The baths were
supplied with water from the sea and the Albula.” At the dedication of
this magnificent building, all that he said in praise of it was: “Now at
last I have begun to live like a gentleman.” They charged Nero with the
murder of all his relatives, and there is a grim sort of humour in the
story of his frequent attempts upon his mother’s life. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_257" id="page_257">{257}</a></span> grievance
against her was that she was too strict. First, he deprived her of her
bodyguard, and suborned people to harass her with lawsuits which drove
her out of the city. In her retirement he set others to follow her about
by land and sea with abuse and scurrilous language. Three times he
attempted her life by poison, but finding she had previously rendered
herself immune by the use of antidotes, he next designed machinery to
make the floor above her bed-chamber collapse while she was asleep. When
this failed he constructed a special coffin-ship, which could be made to
fall in pieces, and then sent her a loving invitation to visit him at
Baiæ, the Brighton of the Romans. The ships of her escort were likewise
instructed to ram her by accident on the way home. He attended her to
the vessel in a very cheerful spirit and kissed her bosom at parting
with her. After which he sat up late at night waiting with great anxiety
for the joyful news of her decease. But news arrived that the accident
had miscarried, the dowager empress was swimming to shore. When her
freedman came joyfully to narrate her escape, Nero pretended that the
man had come to assassinate him and ordered her to be put to death.
Suetonius adds “on good authority” that he went to view her corpse and
criticised her blemishes to his followers, and then called for drink.
After this he was haunted by her ghost.</p>

<p>The famous story of his death is told with a little restraint, and the
latter part of it is not incredible. When the first bad news came of the
revolt of Vindex with the legions of Gaul, Nero summoned his privy
council and held a hasty consultation with them about the crisis, but
spent the rest of the day in showing them a hydraulic organ and
discoursing upon the intricacies of the invention. Then he composed a
skit upon the rebels, and prepared a pathetic speech which was to make
the mutineers return to his allegiance in tears. He sat down to compose
the songs of triumph which should be sung upon that occasion. In
preparing his expedition his first thought was to provide carriages for
the band: he equipped all his<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_258" id="page_258">{258}</a></span> concubines as Amazons with battle-axes
and bucklers. But when he heard of the revolt of the Spanish army under
Galba also, he fell into a temper and tore the dispatch to pieces. He
broke his precious cups and put up a dose of Locusta’s poison in a
golden box. He ordered the prætorian guard to rally round him, but they
only quoted Vergil to him:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Is death indeed so hard a lot?”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">At midnight he awoke and found that the guards had deserted his bedside.
Even his bedding and his golden box of poison had been stolen. So he
stumbled out into the night as if he would throw himself into the Tiber.
But a few faithful slaves came to him and a freedman offered him his
country villa for a refuge, and Nero rode thither in a shabby disguise.
An earthquake shook the ground and a flash of lightning darted in his
face; he heard the soldiers in the prætorian camp shouting for Galba.
Skulking among bushes and briers, he crawled on all fours to a wretched
outhouse of his freedman’s villa. There he ordered them to dig a grave
and line it with scraps of marble. The water and wood for his obsequies
were prepared, while he uttered the famous words “<i>qualis artifex
pereo!</i>” either meaning “What an artist the world is losing!” or (more
probably) “What an artistic death!” A dispatch came to announce that he
had been declared a public enemy by the senate, and was to be punished
according to the ancient custom of the Romans. He asked what sort of
death that meant, and was informed that the criminal was generally
stripped naked and scourged to death with his head in a pillory. Then he
took up daggers and tried the points, but still he dared not die. He
begged one of his attendants to give him the example. At last he heard
the horsemen coming, quoted a line of the <i>Iliad</i> very appropriately,
and drove, with the help of his secretary, a dagger into his throat.</p>

<p>Now, even of this, three-quarters is pure rhetoric. For example, it was
impossible that Nero should have heard the soldiers in the Esquiline
Camp from the road which he took to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_259" id="page_259">{259}</a></span> his servant’s villa. The details
are the invention of malice, or the attempt of a literary artist to
improve his story. Even Suetonius admits that the populace continued to
deck Nero’s tomb with spring and summer flowers, that they dressed up
his image and placed it on the rostra as if he were still alive, and
that a pretender, who arose in his name twenty years later, was received
with acclamation among the Parthians.</p>

<p>Having made this concession to the literary tradition which can be shown
to be very largely fiction, we may now endeavour to gather up the
fragments of history and briefly trace the progress of the Empire during
its first century. First, as to its geographical growth; although
Augustus had bequeathed in his testament the advice not to enlarge the
frontiers of the Empire, and Tiberius had observed the precept, yet
conquest still remained an object of ambition in the heart of every
emperor who sought military renown or fresh sources of revenue. Britain,
the declined legacy of Julius, was obviously beckoning the Romans.
Diplomatic relations with the many kings of that island had always been
frequent, and it was found that Britain was an inconvenient neighbour
for a rapidly Romanising Gaul. There was a continual coming and going
across the water, for there were kindred peoples on each side.
Especially, it was the last refuge of the anti-Roman force of Druidism,
a religion which was already declining and was suppressed by Claudius in
Gaul. That this was so is shown by the forward movement of the Romans in
the direction of Anglesey. The details of the conquest of Britain are,
in spite of voluminous discussions, by no means certain. Aulus Plautius
Silvanus with four legions, and with the future emperor Vespasian as one
of his brigadiers, defeated Cymbeline and ten other kings of South
Britain, crossed the Thames and conquered Colchester (Camulodunum),
which became a Roman <i>colonia</i> and the centre of government. This was in
<small>A.D.</small> 43, and Claudius himself spent a fortnight in our island in order
to receive the honours of victory. The conquest was not too easily
achieved, for there<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_260" id="page_260">{260}</a></span> were five great battles in which the emperor,
though absent, received the titles of victory. Plautius himself seems to
have reached the line of the Trent and Severn. Ostorius Scapula, his
successor, was mainly occupied in subduing the Silures of the Welsh
mountains, and in the conquest of the elusive prince Caradoc. The mercy
shown to that defeated hero proves that the Romans had advanced in
humanity since the days of Jugurtha. The two succeeding legates made no
fresh advance, but Suetonius Paulinus in <small>A.D.</small> 59-61 established Chester
as his western camp. While he was engaged in the conquest of Anglesey,
leaving only the ninth legion to hold the conquered province, there
broke out the great rebellion under the heroic Boudicca. There never has
been a quarrel in this island which has not had money as its root. It
was not so much the oppressive nature of the tribute as the vexatious
methods of the Roman financiers, who still as in republican days swarmed
in the wake of eagles, that stirred the Iceni and their queen into
revolt. Camulodunum, Verulamium, and Londinium were taken and sacked and
there was an immense slaughter of Roman civilians and Romanised Britons.
But vengeance followed: no barbarians could stand against the strategy
and discipline of the legions.</p>

<p>Succeeding governors were mainly content to pacify and civilise the
island.</p>

<p>One of the extraordinarily pungent chapters of Tacitus shows us the
Roman method of empire-building in Britain. “The following winter,” he
says of <small>A.D.</small> 79, “was spent in useful statecraft. To make a people which
was scattered and barbarous, and therefore prone to warfare, grow
accustomed to peace and quietness by way of their pleasures, Agricola
used to persuade them by private exhortations and public assistance to
build temples, forums, and houses, with praise for the eager and
admonitions for the laggard. Thus they could not help embarking on the
rivalry for honour. Now he began to instruct the sons of chieftains in
the liberal arts, to extol the natural abilities of the Britons above
the</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="nind"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_261" id="page_261">{261}</a></span> studious habits of Gaul, so that those who lately rejected even the
Roman language now became zealous for oratory. So even our dress came
into esteem, and the toga was commonly worn. The next step was towards
the attractions of our vices, lounging in colonnades, baths, and refined
dinner-parties. They were too ignorant to see that what they call
civilisation was really a form of slavery.” There is no doubt that the
Britons took as readily as their Gallic cousins to the Roman
civilisation. Many of them took Roman names and became Roman citizens.
They learnt the pleasures of the bath and the amphitheatre, their mines
were exploited, arts and industries were introduced, agriculture was
improved. The Druids hid themselves away in the unconquered fastnesses
of Wales or crossed over to the Hibernian island which the Romans never
had leisure to conquer. Meanwhile the Britons were learning to worship
the obsolete gods of Rome, and presently the Eastern deities who came in
their train.</p>

<p>It was the father-in-law of Tacitus, Julius Agricola, who conquered, or
at least defeated, the northern tribes of England. Among the powerful
Brigantes he established a garrison at York (Eburacum), which eventually
became the most important of all the Roman centres. He advanced into
Scotland also, and inflicted a bloody defeat upon the wild Caledonians.
But Scotland remained unconquered, as did the neighbouring island upon
which also Agricola had cast his ambitious eyes. The Roman army was
wanted elsewhere, and the Emperor Domitian declined to assist any
further adventures. Little more of our island’s story is recorded until
the travelling Emperor Hadrian came out to visit us in <small>A.D.</small> 122. He saw
that the wild north was only to be won by a gradual advance with more or
less peaceful penetration northwards. The system of fortified frontiers
was already established on the Rhine and Danube, and Hadrian drew his
finger across the seventy miles between Bowness and Wallsend. Across
this space, where the Tyne and Solway almost overlap, the Roman lines
ran straight over hill and dale, and there they are to this day as a
silent proof of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_262" id="page_262">{262}</a></span> greatness of the Roman people.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> This was more
than a frontier: it was a vast elongated camp which looked south as well
as north and frowned alike upon the Brigantes and the Caledonians. It
was pierced at intervals by fortified gates and great roads ran
northwards through it. On the north there was first a ditch, and then a
stone wall broad enough for two or three men to walk abreast along it
and nearly twenty feet high. Behind this, in a space of about 140 yards
wide runs a road connecting a chain of fourteen large camps, some of
which grew into towns. Southward again was the quadruple rampart of
earth, a mound, a dyke, and then a double mound. This immense labour,
though it is small in comparison with Roman works elsewhere, was
achieved not by British slaves, but by Roman soldiers, some of whom were
Britons, some Spaniards, and some Germans. It was completed gradually
under various emperors. There were detached forts both north and south
of the wall of Hadrian. It was Antoninus Pius who made the next step
twenty years later. The Antonine wall from the Forth to the Clyde is
only about half as long and of inferior strength. There were camps even
north of this, in Stirlingshire for example, and it is clear that the
Romans intended to feel their way into the Highlands. But that was
contrary to their fates.</p>

<p>Gaul meanwhile was becoming as civilised as Italy herself. Numbers of
the Gauls who had acquired the Latin speech received the <i>jus Latinum</i>,
which was almost equivalent to full citizenship. Claudius admitted the
chiefs of the Ædui into the Roman senate, and part of the speech in
which he did so is preserved on bronze tablets at Lyons. Twice in the
course of the century there were interesting attempts to give political
expression to the Gallic sense of nationality. The revolt of Vindex at
the close of Nero’s reign was little more than a mutiny, but the
projected “Empire of the Gauls,” which was set up during the confusion
which followed the fall of Vitellius, came very near success. Jealousy
between the Gauls and Germans wrecked it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_263" id="page_263">{263}</a></span></p>

THE COLUMN OF TRAJAN</p>

<p>In the case of Germany, it looked for a time as if Tiberius, who, of
course, had personal knowledge of the difficulties and advantages of
further conquest, meant to break his stepfather’s precept and annex more
territory. But probably the annual expeditions of Germanicus were not
intended to be more than punitive and demonstrative. Blood enough was
shed, and acres enough laid waste, to appease the unburied ghosts of
Varus and his legions. But though the great battle of Idistavisus was
hailed as a Roman victory, Arminius himself continually eluded the
Romans and the legions were more than once in peril of ambush. When
Tiberius cried halt, it was open to the critics to find a malevolent
explanation in his jealousy of Germanicus, but it is much more likely to
have been the deliberate policy of an emperor who had knowledge of
Germany. Thus, although Arminius presently fell a victim to his own
ambition, and perished by the dagger of a tyrannicide kinsman, he had
done his work and saved the liberty of Germany. Henceforth the Romans
confined themselves to the Rhine frontier, though they had posts and
summer camps beyond it. By degrees the generals of the Upper and Lower
Armies in Germany developed into governors of two German provinces, but
Germany was unconquered. There was a great military road along the left
bank of the Rhine joining the garrison towns where the legions were
quartered. Mogontiacum (Mainz) and Vetera Castra (Xanten) remained as
the head-quarters, until the latter was superseded by Cologne (Colonia
Agrippinensis) founded under Claudius. Trier (Augusta Treverorum),
another foundation of about the same date, grew into an important centre
of Roman civilisation, as its majestic Roman gate<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> and fine
amphitheatre still bear witness. Under Claudius also the great Via
Claudia over the Brenner Pass was completed, and the canal joining the
Maas to the Rhine. This was better work for Roman soldiers than
slaughtering Chatti and Chauci in their native forests. The re-entrant
angle of the Rhine and Danube about the Black Forest, where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_264" id="page_264">{264}</a></span> rivers
run small, was recognised as a danger-point. The barbarian Germans were
accordingly cleared away to make room for a body of Gallic emigrants,
who received lands on condition of paying a tithe of their produce as
rent, and of undertaking their own defence. This was a new piece of
frontier policy which was often imitated in later times.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Limes" id="Limes"></a>

<div class="caption"><p>Roman <i>Limes</i></p></div>
</div>

<p>It seems to have been the Flavian emperors, Vespasian and Domitian, who
advanced a step farther. On the other side of the Rhine and beyond these
Agri Decumates the Romans began to construct a line of forts and wooden
watch-towers linked by a rampart of earth, and known as the <i>Limes
Trans-Rhenanus</i>. This frontier of Upper Germany left the Rhine between
Linz and Andernach, crossed the Lahn at Ems, and then turned eastwards
north of Wiesbaden (Aquæ Mattiacæ) and Frankfort. After Saalburg it runs
on a north-easterly curve to Gruningen, whence it turns south, and
continues for more than 100 miles through Aschaffenburg and Worth to
join the Rhætian <i>limes</i> at Lorch. From Lorch the Rhætian <i>limes</i> goes
eastwards to join the Danube a few miles above Regensburg. At first
perhaps it was little more than a police and customs limit, but it
gradually grew into a formidable barrier behind which the Roman Empire
rested in a too profound security. Trajan continued it. Hadrian
strengthened it with a wall and palisade. Commodus further fortified and
extended it. A similar bulwark ran along the Danube.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="nind">This policy of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_265" id="page_265">{265}</a></span>
setting up immobile defences like the Great Wall of China is always a
dangerous one. Useful at first and visibly strong, it tends to lull the
defenders into a false security. The camps and forts grew into towns,
the armies into peaceful citizens living with their wives and children
and devoting themselves to trade and husbandry. Meanwhile the barbarians
on the other side were growing stronger and learning the art of war as
fast as the Romans were forgetting it.</p>

<p>After this the danger-point for the Empire shifted gradually eastwards
down the Danube. Claudius had converted Thrace from an allied kingdom
into a Roman province in <small>A.D.</small> 46. Much difficulty was caused by the
Dacians, who lived just across the Danube on the north bank opposite the
Roman province of Mœsia and in the modern Roumania. As the Danube was
apt to become frozen in winter it ceased to offer a satisfactory
frontier, so long as there were powerful enemies on the other side. At
first the Romans tried the system of transplanting them, 50,000 under
Augustus and 100,000 under Nero, and settling them in the province of
Mœsia. But it was a stupid policy, for it meant constant intrigues
between the free barbarians and their enslaved kinsfolk. Vespasian
accordingly moved two legions down from Dalmatia to reinforce the two
already stationed in Mœsia. But presently there arose an able and heroic
king called Decebalus, who welded the Dacians into a compact and
organised kingdom, and began to menace the security of the Empire. Like
Marbod of Bohemia, he drilled his barbarians on the Roman model. In <small>A.D.</small>
85 he invaded Mœsia, won victories and did great damage. Domitian,
called upon to face this peril, was content with inflicting a single
defeat upon them and then accepting Decebalus as a client prince. He
gave him Roman engineers and artillerymen, and even sent gifts of money
which the barbarians were pleased to regard as tribute. This has been
set down as cowardice, but it was certainly unwisdom in Domitian, for
Decebalus grew stronger and more dangerous. It was left for Trajan, the
greatest soldier of all the early emperors, to face this thorny<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_266" id="page_266">{266}</a></span> problem
in the two great Dacian Wars of 101 and 105 <small>B.C.</small> The whole war is
depicted for us by pictures in stone. The spiral reliefs which cover the
column of Trajan tell us, with far more detail than the narrative of
Dio, the history of the two Dacian Wars. We see the embarkation of the
Roman army, we see it on the march with its scouts in advance, we see
the solemn purifications, sacrifices, and harangues which preceded
battle. We see the battles themselves, in which the Romans with sword
and <i>pilum</i> defeat the Dacians and their mail-clad Sarmatian cavalry.
The great bridge built across the Danube at Viminacium by the Greek
architect Apollodorus is faithfully depicted. We can watch the siege of
the Dacian capital, Sarmizegethusa, and observe the construction of the
siege-engines. Scenes of pathos are most graphically portrayed, the
torturing of Roman prisoners by the barbarian women, the suicide of the
Dacian chiefs by poison, and the death of the heroic Decebalus. At
intervals throughout the story there appears and reappears the calm and
stately figure of Trajan, steering his ship, sacrificing for victory,
leading the march or the charge, haranguing his troops, directing the
labour of engineering, consulting with his officers, or receiving the
submission of the foe.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>The end of the two wars was that Dacia was annexed and became a province
of the Empire. Here, as elsewhere, Trajan showed his contempt of natural
frontiers. As a gallant soldier himself, he believed in the
invincibility of the Roman arms, and preferred to put his trust in
legions rather than in walls. For this he has been condemned by modern
historians, but history is on his side. More than anything else it was
reliance on natural frontiers and artificial ramparts, with the
consequent loss of military instincts, which was to be the undoing of
the Roman Empire.</p>

<p>On the eastern frontier it was for a long time a game of tug-of-war
between Rome and Parthia, the rope being supplied by the kingdom of
Armenia. The Augustan policy of filling<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_267" id="page_267">{267}</a></span> the oriental thrones with
princes trained at Rome was not a great success. You might learn bad
lessons at court; you might even learn to know Rome without learning to
love or fear her. The princes sent to Armenia or Parthia were unstable
allies and the ordinary course of events was for the Romans to send out
a king to Armenia and for the Parthians to depose him. Again it was left
for Trajan to attack this problem in the old Roman fashion; when the
usual submissive embassy arrived, Trajan answered, as a Metellus might
have done, that he wanted deeds not words, and he led his army on.
Trajan found the Eastern legions, whose headquarters were at Antioch,
already civilianised and orientalised so that they had become useless
for fighting. At this time there were four legions in Syria, one in
Judæa and one in the new province of Cappadocia. The first task was to
restore discipline and energy to these troops. Then, without bloodshed,
in <small>A.D.</small> 115 Armenia was declared a province. Parthia, distracted by
civil war, was overrun, its capital Ctesiphon easily taken by siege.
Mesopotamia was made a province, and to Parthia was given a new king.
The client kingdom of Adiabene became a third new province under the
name of Assyria. This meant that the Tigris became the eastern frontier
instead of the Euphrates. Unfortunately these conquests had been too
easily achieved, largely through the temporary dissensions of the
Parthians, who accordingly failed to experience the salutary discipline
of real defeat. Trajan died on his way home, and Hadrian, who was more
of a statesman than a warrior, reversed his predecessor’s policy. He
surrendered the three new provinces and even acquiesced in the
Parthians’ choice of a king of their own in place of the Roman nominee.
The only new provinces of Trajan’s creation which Hadrian retained were
Dacia and Arabia.</p>

<p>Although their military force was contemptible, their spiritual zeal
made the Jews the most difficult people to govern in the whole empire.
Worshipping their Jealous God with fierce ardour, they could not join in
the Cæsar-worship which<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_268" id="page_268">{268}</a></span> was the outward sign of loyalty and patriotism
throughout the Roman world. Moreover the Semitic question had already
begun to vex the soul of Europe. Throughout the East and especially in
the trade centres such as Antioch, Alexandria, and Cyrene there were
already large communities of Jews who lived on the usual terms of
deep-rooted racial animosity with their neighbours. It is only fair to
the Roman government to admit that it tried to conciliate its difficult
subjects. Though the vanity of Caligula led him to accept the suggestion
of erecting a colossal statue of him in the Temple at Jerusalem, yet
when the philosopher Philo and his fellow-ambassadors came over to plead
against the outrage the emperor good-humouredly remarked that if people
refused to worship him it was more their misfortune than their fault. As
a rule the Roman procurators who administered Galilee and Judæa were
almost too tolerant of Jewish fanaticism. The Jews were exempt from
military service: their Sabbaths were respected. A Roman soldier who
tore a book of the law was put to death. It was useless to argue with
such sects as the Zealots and Assassins. The Anti-Semite spirit broke
out into massacres. In Cæsarea, Damascus, and elsewhere the Gentiles
slew the Jews; in Alexandria and Cyrene the Jews slaughtered the
Gentiles. In Jerusalem the Romans had to face violent discord between
the rival factions, and naturally they sided with the more tolerant and
moderate Sadducees against the stern Pharisees and the smaller sects of
extremists. In <small>A.D.</small> 66 matters came to a crisis. A Roman garrison was
attacked and destroyed: the army which came from Syria to avenge them
was repulsed with slaughter. This occurred while the Emperor Nero was on
one of his theatrical tours in Greece, and in the next year Vespasian
was sent with an army of three legions and auxiliaries which increased
its numbers to more than 50,000. During the death of Nero and the short
reigns of his three successors, Vespasian was gradually subduing
Palestine and driving the irreconcilables before him into Jerusalem.
Vespasian himself became emperor and it was left to his son Titus to
finish the tragedy.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_269" id="page_269">{269}</a></span> The siege of Jerusalem (<small>A.D.</small> 70) was one of the
most difficult tasks which the Romans ever had to face. In addition to
its natural strength there were six lines of fortification to be
overcome one by one, and each was defended with all the grim tenacity of
which the Semite race is capable when it is on the defensive. Five
months the great siege lasted, and at the end Jerusalem was a heap of
ruins. Some of the temple treasures were saved for the Roman triumph,
and the Arch of Titus still shows us the famous seven-branched golden
candlestick being carried up to the temple of Capitoline Jove.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> It is
said that one million Jews perished in the siege and 100,000 more were
sold into slavery. Jerusalem became merely the camp of the Tenth Legion.
All Judæa became one province, and the scattered Jews were only allowed
to keep their privileges on condition of registering their names and
paying a fee of two denarii every year for their licence.</p>

<p>But this awful lesson had not quenched the fire of Jewish patriotism nor
killed their hopes of an earthly Messiah who should restore the kingdom
of David. Once again under Hadrian there was a Jewish rebellion
stimulated by the fact that the emperor forbade the rite of circumcision
and decreed the foundation of a Roman colony at Jerusalem with a temple
to Jupiter on Mount Zion. The revolt was stamped out with merciless
severity and the Jews were scattered for ever.</p>

<p>The only other noteworthy addition to the Roman Empire was Mauretania
(Morocco), which was incorporated as a province by Caligula. The motive
alleged was the emperor’s desire to possess himself of the treasures of
Ptolemy, its king.</p>

<p>On the whole, then, we can see that the Roman Empire had almost reached
its natural limits. It had seized as much as it could govern, and now,
with the exception of the Parthian kingdom, all that lay outside its
frontiers was naked barbarism. So the centre grew more and more
unwarlike, while the legions had little to occupy their minds except the
speculation whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_270" id="page_270">{270}</a></span> their particular general had a chance of the
purple. For this reason alone the Cæsars were loth to embark on
conquests, unless like Trajan they were willing to neglect everything
else and undertake the campaigns in person. A victorious general was
always to be dreaded by his master.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Principate</span></h3>

<p>At first sight the position of the princeps, who was absolute lord of
this world, is one of immense and terrible power. But earthly power has
its natural limits in human weakness. The weak or wicked emperors were
generally the servants of their favourites, male or female, or they
lived under fear of the legions. Without their bureaux they were
helpless, and the bureaux in the skilled hands of Roman knights or Greek
freedmen were acquiring the real power. But it is astonishing how much
actual work was done by the more conscientious Cæsars. In Pliny’s
letters we see what minute details were referred by a provincial
governor to his master and how minutely they were answered. The answers
may be, and no doubt sometimes are, the composition of secretaries, but
there is a personal note in them which often suggests the emperor’s own
dictation. Probably Trajan was exceptionally industrious and Pliny
exceptionally meticulous. Nevertheless it looks as if a strong emperor
actually ruled this vast domain. It is one of the merits of despotism
that the monarch’s power increases automatically with his virtues and
capacity. A Caligula could not do so much harm: an Augustus, a Claudius,
a Trajan, or a Hadrian might benefit millions of mankind. I think it is
clear that they did so. The insane work of slaughter, which is all that
interests the ordinary historian, had almost ceased. All over the world
the markets were full, the workshops were noisy with hammers, the seas
were thronged with ships, the great highways busy with travellers.
Justice was strong and even-handed. Taxes were low and equitably
assessed. For the most part men had liberty to go their own ways and
worship their own gods. From the accession of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_271" id="page_271">{271}</a></span></p>

<p class="nind">Augustus to the death of
Antoninus Pius&mdash;and with a few intervals one might safely go
further&mdash;the world was enjoying one of its golden periods of prosperity.
It is unhistorical to look ahead and pronounce this happy world to be
already doomed.</p>

<p>Yet, on the other hand, it is idle to deny the unsound spots in this
imposing fabric of empire. The weakness was at the centre. The Roman
aristocracy was gay and splendid, but not happy or secure. The ghost of
the Republic still haunted her streets. To make a necessary repetition:
if Augustus had been succeeded by a son as wise and tactful as himself,
and if the throne had then passed to a third generation with the
soldierly qualities of Trajan and the statesmanship of Diocletian, the
Empire might have taken shape as a strong hereditary monarchy with a
senate co-operating heartily, and an army obeying loyally. But that was
not fated so. Tiberius was too proud to play the comedy as Augustus had
done: instead he made enemies of the aristocracy and became suspicious
and tyrannical. When they lampooned and abused him, he turned into a
despot. Cremutius Cordus, the historian, was executed for calling
Cassius “the last of the Romans.” At last Tiberius withdrew himself in
gloomy despair and left the government in the hands of an unscrupulous
intriguer, the knight Sejanus, who still further harried and alienated
the nobles. It is hard to know the truth about Gaius, so palpably is his
story written by satirists. He may have been mad. The adulation which
surrounded the Cæsars was enough to turn the head of a vain youth. He
was certainly extravagant and increased his unpopularity by taxes upon
litigants and prostitutes. It was the officers of the prætorian guard
who conspired to assassinate him.</p>

<p>Claudius was chosen by the bodyguard who had murdered his predecessor
and he bought their allegiance with £120 apiece. He was the uncle of
Caligula, but no process of adoption had lifted him into the royal
house. Still he was the grandson of Livia and his assumption of the name
“Cæsar” passed without comment. Claudius set Augustus before him as his
model and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_272" id="page_272">{272}</a></span> in all things he was careful to return to republican
precedents. He took the office of censor for the revision of the
senate-roll. He increased the patriciate, encouraged the State religion
and by personal attention improved the administration of justice. The
cause of most of the trouble during the preceding reigns had been the
practice of “delation.” Even under the Republic criminal prosecutions
had been the easiest method of obtaining political notoriety. Tiberius
and Gaius had added the motive of pecuniary gain. Claudius now repealed
the obnoxious laws of treason, punished the laying of information and
forbade slaves to give evidence against their masters. By the repeal of
the treason laws Claudius had almost ceased to be a monarch, and he was
careful to revive the old legislative processes of the republic. On the
other hand, under Claudius the power of the bureaucracy was greatly
increased, and the affairs of the Empire were principally conducted by
the three powerful Greek secretaries.</p>

<p>On the death of Claudius&mdash;when the emperors died in their beds poison
was invariably alleged&mdash;Nero succeeded almost as a matter of course. His
mother Agrippina had secured his succession by having him raised to
honour just as had been done for Tiberius by Augustus. He had already
been styled “Prince of the Youth,” designated for the consulship and
endowed with the proconsular power. There was, however, a possible rival
in the young Britannicus, and Nero was chosen by the prætorian guard
just as clearly as Claudius. During the first five years, when the young
prince was engaged in enjoying himself under the guidance of the
philosopher Seneca, the senate had nothing to fear, and the Roman state
enjoyed its liberty, but when Tigellinus, the wicked prefect of the
guard, gained his evil ascendancy over the mind of Nero there were some
prosecutions of influential senators which made the whole senate
tremble. Yet, even in these worst days of the worst of emperors, good
administration proceeded. Nero himself made an interesting proposal for
the abolition of customs in the Empire and, indeed, may fairly be called
“The Father of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_273" id="page_273">{273}</a></span> Free Trade.” But the capitalist class succeeded in
suppressing the proposal. The duties on corn were, however, reduced and
the collection of taxes carefully regulated. Charges of extortion
against tax-collectors were given precedence in the law courts, a
measure of justice beyond anything that the modern state has attempted.
It was much more the dancing and singing of the <i>princeps</i> than the
extortions of Tigellinus and the judicial murders of noblemen which
caused the unpopularity which brought Nero to his doom. Among the many
who fell victims to the ferocity of Tigellinus&mdash;for Nero himself was
probably harmless enough&mdash;were two genuine Republicans of the old
school, men who were genuine believers in the Stoic faith and who kept
the birthdays of Brutus and Cassius as annual feasts. It is probable
that genuine opposition of this sort was far from rare among the
aristocracy of the Empire. Writers like Lucan and Tacitus were evidently
in sympathy with it, and though Thrasea Pætus and Barea Soranus are
famous for the Stoic deaths they died, yet they were only two out of
many who lived wholly on the memory of the Republic.</p>

<p>Nero’s fall was caused directly by the defection of the prætorian
guards, whose allegiance had been bought in the name of Galba. Nero was
the last member of the Julio-Claudian family, and at his death the last
shadow of dynastic claim passed away. The succession of the principate
became a mere scramble in which the strongest or the luckiest or the
heaviest briber won the day. Pretenders sprang up against Galba, several
of the armies put forward their generals as competitors for the throne;
and Galba himself had not even enough generosity to pay the bribes by
which he had secured his throne. Thus the year 69 was a year of
incessant civil war. Galba was murdered in the streets of Rome; Otho was
defeated in battle near Bedriacum and slain in his camp, Vitellius; the
choice of the legions in Germany, reigned from April to December, when
Rome was once more occupied by a citizen army. The legions of Syria,
seeing that their fellow-soldiers<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_274" id="page_274">{274}</a></span> of Spain and Germany had already made
their generals into emperors, had determined to take a hand in the game,
and now Vespasian came as the fourth Cæsar in the space of a single
year.</p>

<p>It speaks well for the solidity of the imperial system as organised by
Augustus that it survived the shock of such events as these. It proves
that the system was everything and the man little or nothing.</p>

<p>The new Emperor Vespasian, who succeeded after all this turmoil, was
different from his predecessors in that he had two grown-up sons ready
to succeed him. It is said that Mucianus, a still more powerful Eastern
general, had surrendered his claims because he was childless. If so, it
was nobly and wisely done. Vespasian was able and willing to restore the
machinery of the Augustan principate. He was himself frankly a humble
Sabine with no claims of birth. He was firm but not oppressive towards
the senate, and he kept control over the prætorian guard by appointing
Titus, his son, to its command. He also established the succession
beyond doubt by making Titus his consort. Vespasian and Titus were
elected consuls year by year. Vespasian’s principal work was to restore
the financial credit of the government. Unfortunately the two sons,
Titus, and then Domitian, who followed him upon the throne and with him
make up the “Flavian” dynasty, were scarcely worthy of their father.
Titus was “the darling of the human race,” generous and mild to the
senators, but too fond of his popularity to be a strong ruler, and
Domitian was a genuine tyrant. With his autocratic system of rule he was
naturally oppressive to the aristocracy, and his name is in consequence
written on the pages of history as that of a monster of cruelty.
Domitian certainly made constitutional changes which rendered the
monarchy a more open fact. He took the consulship for ten years to come,
he became censor and drew up the senate-roll to suit his fancy, he
refused the usual request of the senators that the emperor should admit
that he had no power to condemn a senator to death. Also he openly
spurned the proud<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_275" id="page_275">{275}</a></span> senators and permitted the servile modes of address
which Augustus and other emperors had forbidden.</p>

<p>These high-handed proceedings made the senators hate and plot against
him. Plots were followed by executions, and Domitian gradually became
more and more tyrannical. More of the Stoic Republican party were
executed, and the odious practice of delation came once more into vogue.
At last there was a successful plot organised in the palace, and
Domitian fell to the dagger.</p>

<p>With the three succeeding emperors, Nerva (96-98), Trajan (98-117), and
Hadrian (117-138), we have a series of genuine constitutional rulers who
show the system of the principate at its best. The excellent figure
which these rulers cut on the page of history is not wholly unconnected
with the fact that we have now passed beyond the region illuminated by
the satire of Tacitus and the tittle-tattle of Suetonius. Their deeds
speak for them. In Nerva we have the senate’s choice of a ruler,
elderly, blameless, but decidedly weak. Had he not died in less than two
years, he could easily have brought the throne of the Cæsars down to the
ground. Knowing his own weakness, Nerva had adopted the foremost soldier
of his day as his heir, and Trajan, beloved of the soldiers and ready to
purchase the love of the Rome rabble, succeeded without a murmur. He
spent most of his reign in the camp. In the camp he died, and the
succession was by no means clear when Hadrian, a kinsman though a
distant one, had the courage to seize and the luck to hold the imperial
power. All these three emperors granted the senate’s claim that the
emperor should not have the power to condemn a senator to death, and in
some aspects the senate seemed to have regained much of its old
independence. But Trajan was too masterful and Hadrian too ubiquitous to
leave any real scope for senatorial initiative. It was really under
these benevolent despots that the Dyarchy ceased to have any
significance. As usual the benevolence of the despot was the most fatal
enemy to liberty. Not only in Rome but even in the municipalities of
Italy politics were ceasing to have any real<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_276" id="page_276">{276}</a></span> meaning, and men of
standing had to be coerced into taking part in the comedy. The
bureaucracy of the imperial palace now governed the world, and the
better it governed the more quickly did the life-blood of the Roman
world run dry in its veins. We now find imperial “curators” and
accountants going up and down the provinces to set their finances in
order. Whenever there is trouble in any corner of the earth, an imperial
“corrector” travels down from Rome by the admirable system of imperial
posts to set it right. Where, of old, a local squire, the patronus of
the municipality, would leave a charitable legacy for the maintenance
and education of poor children, the state with its admirable system of
“alimenta” was beginning to assume the responsibility. The state had its
Development Fund which made loans on mortgage at very low interest,
generally 5 but sometimes 2½ per cent., to small farmers, and the
interest was applied to orphanages and the education of the poor. Nerva
has the credit for introducing this splendid system of public charity
and Hadrian developed it. It was Hadrian also who gave the finishing
touches to the organisation of the civil service as a close bureaucracy
entirely divorced from the military profession. This service was chiefly
in the hands of the knights, and it ranged in a carefully graded
hierarchy of officialdom down from the three principal Secretaries of
State, the Finance Minister, the Chief Secretary, and the Minister of
Petitions, down to the Fiscal Advocates who looked after local revenue.
Though the Roman Empire is often represented as groaning under the
weight of taxation, and no doubt the more extravagant emperors did amass
heavy liabilities, yet Hadrian, who followed an emperor extravagant both
in warfare and building, was able to remit about nine millions sterling
of arrears due to the fisc. He also introduced a system of periodical
reassessments and gave the fullest liberty for his tenants-in-chief to
appeal against the collectors. Hadrian it was, also, who really
introduced the system of installing a junior colleague in the Empire, a
plan which Augustus had foreshadowed in his elevation of Tiberius.</p>

plan produced one of the firmest dynasties which ever held the imperial
throne, namely, the Antonines, Marcus Aurelius, Titus, Antoninus Pius,
and Commodus, who ruled from Hadrian’s death in 138 to 192. The age of
the first two Antonines is considered by Gibbon and many others to be
the culmination of the Roman imperial system.</p>

<p>Two facts of very great importance stand out from this hasty review of
the principate during its first two centuries. In the first place, it is
still, in the strict constitutional sense, a compromise. The theory of
the constitution had not changed since Augustus, if, indeed, it had ever
changed. It is still a Republic&mdash;<i>Respublica Romana</i>&mdash;governed by
senate, consuls, tribunes, and an intermittent public assembly. There
is, as there nearly always had been, a <i>princeps</i>, that is, leading
citizen, a man raised by personal eminence and prestige far above his
colleagues. Certain powers are delegated to him by the state. Above all
he is master of the legions because he has consular or proconsular
authority over all the provinces where troops are stationed. There still
remained certain theoretical limitations to his power. He could not, for
example, impose a tax on Rome or Italy by his own authority. But the
feebleness and sycophancy of the senate and magistracy made him actually
omnipotent. When a certain senator was pointed out by Cæsar’s freedman
as an enemy to Cæsar the doomed man was set upon by his colleagues and
stabbed to death with their pens in the senate-house. It is true that
this sycophancy was not altogether the fault of the senate. Under the
tyrannical emperors like Tiberius, Nero, and Domitian, emperors who
encouraged the “delator,” no senator’s life was secure. At a frown from
Cæsar it was customary to go home and open one’s veins after writing a
complimentary will in which one bequeathed everything to that best of
rulers. This sort of behaviour led inevitably to the growth of the
monarchy. The emperor was the one person who dared to act, and the more
capable and well-intentioned the ruler, the more closely were the
fetters <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_278" id="page_278">{278}</a></span>riveted around the necks of the Roman People. The silent growth
of bureaucracy, of which the historians have little to tell us, but
which we can gather from the inscriptions of the period, is both the
symptom and the cause of this increasing power of the principate.</p>

<p>In the second place, it is important to notice that although the city of
Rome was growing marvellously in riches and splendour, she was losing
her old domination in the world, and becoming the capital instead of the
mistress of the Empire. The magistracies of the city had almost ceased
to have any importance except as inferior grades on the road to
proconsulships. Italy herself was sinking into the position of one among
the provinces of the Empire, and with the growth of Hadrian’s
centralised system of imperial administration even the provinces were
losing their significance as units of government. It seems impossible
that almost the whole of Europe and large parts of Asia and Africa could
ever have been governed by one man or even one bureau. Yet it was almost
achieved by the Roman Empire. The world-state was almost a fact, and a
few more Trajans and Hadrians would have accomplished it. The city-state
idea, as a unit of patriotism, still flourished. But with the great
roads stretching like railways to the four corners of the earth, and the
imperial officers travelling along them, with the legions massed along
the frontiers and men recruited in Spain sent to serve in Britain, the
sense of territory, from which the modern state was to arise, began to
develop itself.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Imperial Rome</span></h3>

<p>If the external history of the Empire has suffered by being so largely
in the hands of the opposition, the intimate life of the city has been
still more distorted through being written for us by satirists. The
humorous or venomous descriptions of Juvenal, Martial, and Petronius
form our principal source of information, and Pliny, who gives us a very
different picture of tranquil and cultivated leisure or of useful
activity carried on in refined and elegant surroundings, has commonly
been regarded as a remarkable exception. Yet the material remains are
on<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_279" id="page_279">{279}</a></span></p>

TOMB OF THE HATERII</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="nind">the side of Pliny; and we owe a great debt to modern writers, like
Dr. Dill, who have been able to emphasise this point. Romances such as
those of Lytton, Melville, and Sienckewicz have embroidered the theme of
Juvenal, and everybody nowadays has his vision of Imperial Rome based
upon such fairy-tales. It is probably vain to attempt a refutation of
the popular view which pictures the Roman of the Empire as exclusively
spending his time in the amphitheatre watching the lions devour the
Christians, except when he was supping on nightingales’ tongues from
plates of gold. Moreover these things are a not unimportant part of the
truth. Imperial Rome remained as bloody and brutal in its amusements as
Republican Rome. In fact, as the emperors were not only richer than the
old senators, but also much more carefully watched and bitterly
lampooned, so the number of wild beasts slain at a <i>venatio</i> of Trajan
exceeded the slaughters exhibited by Pompeius. Doubtless the imperial
epicure Apicius excelled the republican glutton Lucullus in the variety
of his menu, and the lascivious entertainments of Petronius Arbiter and
his master Nero certainly dwarfed the attempts of Sulla. At heart it was
the same Roman People, enjoying the same stupid pleasures and violent
sensations under circumstances of greater magnificence and refinement.
It was a society founded on slavery, acknowledging no limits to the free
indulgence of pleasure. But one misconception must be combated. The
whole imperial period of five centuries should not be regarded as one
slippery Gadarene slope down which the Romans were hurrying to
destruction. Fashions came and went. Extravagance was at its height
under Nero: there was a reaction towards greater simplicity under
Vespasian. Under Trajan and Hadrian life was orderly and refined. Under
M. Aurelius philosophy was even more fashionable than vice. Nor was
bloodshed the only form of public enjoyment; the amphitheatres often
presented spectacles quite as inoffensive and much more splendid than
our modern hippodromes and circuses. Chariot-racing, in particular,
though a good deal more dangerous than the modern steeplechase,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_280" id="page_280">{280}</a></span> took
its place along with gladiators and beast-baiting as the popular sport,
and the Romans showed as much enthusiasm for Coryphæus and Hirpinus as
we do for our Ormondes and Persimmons. The charioteer Lacerna had as
much vogue with them as had Fred Archer with our fathers, and they took
sides with the Prasina Factio even more seriously than we do with Light
or Dark Blue oarsmen. The Romans had an inherited taste for blood. There
were philosophers who condemned gladiatorial shows, but the defence of
the ancient sportsman was similar to and perhaps not less true than the
modern fox-hunter’s excuse: the gladiators themselves enjoyed the fun
almost as much as the spectators.</p>

<p>On the whole, apart from its follies, material civilisation was steadily
advancing during the whole period at present under review. In such
matters as transit, public health, police, water-supply, engineering,
building, and so forth, Rome of the second century left off pretty much
where the reign of Queen Victoria was to resume. The modern city of Rome
is obtaining its drinking-water out of about three of the nine great
aqueducts which ministered to the imperial city. The hot-air system
which warms the hotels of modern Europe and America was in general use
in every comfortable villa of the first century <small>A.D.</small> Education was more
general and more accessible to the poor in <small>A.D.</small> 200 than in <small>A.D.</small> 1850.
The siege artillery employed by Trajan was as effective, probably, as
the cannon of Vauban.</p>

<p>The city of Rome must have been a wonderful spectacle under the
emperors. One of our modern international exhibitions might faintly
recall a little of its splendours, with gilt and stucco for gold and
marble. Northward from the slope of the Aventine Hill there was a
succession of majestic public buildings, temple beyond temple, forum
beyond forum, as each of the great emperors had added to the work of his
predecessor and endeavoured to eclipse it. At your feet would be the
Circus Maximus, where the chariot-races were held, and behind it the
Palatine Hill crowded with palaces. To the east of it ran the Triumphal
Road passing through the Arch of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_281" id="page_281">{281}</a></span></p>

Basilica of Constantine to a series of stately <i>fora</i>, opening one from
the other and containing altars, columns, arches, statues, and temples
surrounded with shady colonnades, whose cloisters served for business
and pleasure. Above them on the west rose the ancient Capitoline Hill
crowned with its great Temple of Jupiter and immemorial citadel. Picture
these magnificent spaces filled with grave citizens in their flowing
white togas, hurrying slaves in their bright tunics, visitors and
barbarians from all corners of the earth, trousered Gauls, skin-clad
Sarmatians, mitred Parthians. Every now and then the burly gladiators
swagger through the crowd admired by every one, or a procession of the
shaven begging priests of Isis passes by with strange cries and
gestures. Perhaps the lictors come swinging down the hill bidding every
one make way for the slaves who carry the litter of the emperor who is
on his way to sacrifice. Or fancy the crowd in the Great Amphitheatre,
which held more than eighty thousand spectators, with the purple and
gold awnings spread to protect them from the blazing sunshine, the
auditorium perfumed with scents and cooled by fountains, and the arena
at their feet flooded with water to present a naval combat. It is a city
wrapped in profound peace, still dreaming amid its splendours that it is
the mistress of the world.</p>

<p>And these signs of magnificent material riches were not confined to
Rome. Alexandria would almost rival her. Asiatic towns like Ephesus and
Antioch presented a similar appearance of luxury and opulence. In the
north Lugudunum and even Londinium had a splendour of their own. In
Gades Spain had a handsome and highly civilised capital. The Roman
remains at Trier utterly dwarf the comfortable erections of a prosperous
modern town. Out in the desert at Palmyra<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> and Ba’albek<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> there

<p class="nind"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_283" id="page_283">{283}</a></span> which testify to the
industry fostered by the provincial government of the emperors. Along
the sea-coast of Campania there were sea-fronts of continuous villas
whose marble fragments are still washed up in the Bay of Naples. It
tasks the imagination of genius to conjure up that glowing world of the
past out of the ruined foundations which remain. Turner’s famous picture
of Baiæ represents a successful attempt to do so. Pompeii, wonderful as
it is, was only a very small and obscure country town. Yet it was
lavishly provided with temples, baths, theatre, and amphitheatre.</p>

<p>On the coast of North Africa, where nothing but man’s labour organised
under a good government is required to make the desert blossom as a
rose, there was a teeming population which prospered on agriculture.
Timgad (Thamugadi) was founded in the year 100 as a colony by Trajan,
and it was the head-quarters of the Third Legion. Here, in the blank
desert of to-day, the French explorers have revealed porticoes and
colonnades, a forum, a municipal senate-house, a theatre, a capitol,
rostra, a triumphal arch, baths, shrines, and temples, together with the
aqueduct and fountains which alone made all this splendour possible.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>
For public munificence this age is unequalled in history. It must have
been a very powerful sense of patriotism which compelled every rich man
to devote so large a part of his fortune to the embellishment of his
native town. The benefactions of the modern millionaire seem miserly in
comparison. Pliny, who was not a very rich man as wealth was accounted
in his day, presented his native town of Como with a library at a cost
of nearly £9000, and maintained it with an annual endowment of more than
£800. He offered to contribute one-third to the cost of a secondary
school, and made the wise provision that the parents of the boys should
contribute the rest, in order that they might feel an interest in the
school and take pains in the choice of suitable teachers. He gave nearly
£5000 more for the support of poor children. He bequeathed more than
£4000 for public baths and nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_284" id="page_284">{284}</a></span> £16,000 to his freedmen and for
public feasts. And, as Dr. Dill has pointed out, the inscriptions of
every municipal town prove that this princely generosity and patriotism
were by no means the exception. “There was in those days an immense
civic ardour, an almost passionate rivalry, to make the mother city a
more pleasant and a more splendid home.” Among the most princely of
these benefactors was the Athenian Professor of Rhetoric, Herodes
Atticus, who added a new quarter to Athens in the reign of Hadrian.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most remarkable feature of life in the Roman Empire under
the good emperors of the second century is the growth of a lower class
with occupations and ideals of its own. We have already remarked that
the poor free Roman of republican days scarcely emerges into the light
except as a soldier. But now the inscriptions show us a happy and
industrious class of artisans and humble tradesmen, grading down through
the freedmen to the slaves, many of whom now lived and worked under
quite tolerable conditions of life. Especially noteworthy is the social
tendency of the day. Every occupation and craft was forming its guilds
or “collegia” about which the inscriptions give us full and most
interesting details. The collegia were not quite Friendly Societies, and
still less Trade Unions, though they undoubtedly claimed political
privileges and perhaps even made some attempt at collective bargaining
with the public. Sometimes they obtained exemption from taxation. They
dined together, they had their chapels and festivals, their colours and
processions. They had officers modelled on the old Roman magistracy,
with senators as committee and a quæstor as treasurer. They had their
list of patrons who were expected to earn the honour by generosity. In
the main they were burial clubs. Even slaves, and even gladiators, the
most despised of slaves, had their guilds and fraternities: of course
they were regulated by the state.</p>

<p>As yet, in spite of its growing centralisation and spirit of paternal
despotism, the Roman government was true to its ancient principle of
allowing full local autonomy. The municipal</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_285" id="page_285">{285}</a></span> life of a small Campanian
town like Pompeii afforded scope for local ambition and a political
ardour to which the election posters and the inscriptions scratched or
scribbled on the walls bear eloquent witness.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> Sometimes the name of
the candidate is written with the laconic addition <i>v. b.</i>, “a good
man,” or it may be “Please make P. Furius duumvir, he’s a good man.” But
occasionally the commendations are more explicit: “a most modest young
man,” “he will look after the treasury,” “worthy of public office,” and
so forth. Sometimes a trade-guild supports its candidate. Thus the
liquor interest in politics is already noticeable in <small>A.D.</small> 70. The humour
of the opposition is seen in such a poster as “the pickpockets request
the election of Vatia as ædile.” And the intrusion of the feminine
element is to be observed in “<i>Claudium IIvir. animula facit</i>” (“His
little darling is working for Claudius as duumvir”). The wit of the
Pompeian wall-scribe was brighter, though not always cleaner, than that
of his modern counterpart. There is the proud inscription “Restitutus
has often deceived many girls,” but there are also testimonies of
conjugal affection like “Hirtia, the Dewdrop, always and everywhere
sends hearty greeting to C. Hostilius, the Gnat, her husband, shepherd
and gentle counsellor.” There is also an interesting account from a
bakery:</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Education and Literature</span></h3>

<p>A noticeable feature of the times was the wide diffusion of education.
Every one, it seems, could read and write, even the slaves, even the
humble British workman. Many a Pompeian schoolboy has scribbled a line
from Vergil, or Ovid, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_286" id="page_286">{286}</a></span> Propertius. Many an adult has added his or her
original compositions. We have seen in the case of Pliny how the rich
men interested themselves in the foundation of schools, both primary and
secondary, for their native towns. In the Greek world, as may be
expected, education was most highly developed and thoroughly graded from
the elementary to the university stage. For elementary schools the
voluntary system was in vogue, but it was under careful public
supervision, and, as we have seen, the state undertook the maintenance
of poor children, girls as well as boys. In contrast to the present day,
the teachers were often held in high honour, and many a public
inscription testifies to the gratitude of a town towards its
schoolmasters. That they also received more substantial recognition is
proved by the fact that they were often able to leave handsome
benefactions themselves. They were elected, sometimes after an
examination or after giving specimen lessons, by the local education
committees, with religious ceremonies, and they took an oath of office
on entering upon their duties. They had their unions and associations
like other professions. In one inscription found in Callipolis, “The
young men and the lads and the boys and their teachers” unite to confer
a wreath of honour upon one of the mathematical masters. The teachers
seem to have been subject to annual election or re-election. There were
also visiting masters of special subjects. The Greek secondary school
tended to lay much stress upon athletics, but it gave more attention to
music and religion than similar institutions of to-day. Reading,
writing, and arithmetic together with music, dancing, and drill were the
staple subjects of the elementary school. “Rhetoric,” which meant the
study of literature on the technical side, as well as the practice of
declamations, was the main occupation in the high schools and the
universities. But philosophy, moral and physical, was also carefully
studied. University professors often rose to real affluence.</p>

HADRIAN’S VILLA, TIVOLI</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>In the polite world of Rome, literature was extremely fashionable.
Everybody was writing and insisting upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_287" id="page_287">{287}</a></span> reading his compositions to
his friends. These literary labours were often pursued with amazing
diligence. Both Pliny and his uncle devoted themselves to reading and
writing almost from morning to night, and Pliny the Younger tells how he
was laughed at for carrying his notebooks with him even when he was out
boar-hunting. By the time he was fourteen he had written a Greek
tragedy. His sketch of a day’s doings at his country villa shows the
literary perseverance of a Roman gentleman. He rose at six and began to
compose in his bedroom. Then he would summon his secretary to take down
the result from dictation. At ten or eleven he would continue his work
in some shady colonnade, or under the trees in the garden, after which
he drove out, still reading. “A short siesta, a walk, declamation in
Greek and Latin, after the habit of Cicero, gymnastic exercise, and the
bath, filled the space until dinner-time arrived.” Even during dinner a
book was read aloud and the evening was enlivened by acting or music or
conversation. Many of Pliny’s friends, such as Suetonius and Silius
Italicus, emulated this studious existence, and his uncle even excelled
it. The elder Pliny consulted two thousand volumes in the writing of his
Natural History alone, and he left one hundred and sixty volumes of
closely written notes and excerpts. Nor was this an unimportant circle
of literary bookworms. On the contrary, it was the highest society of
the day. The elder Pliny was on terms of daily intercourse with the
Emperor Vespasian, and the younger Pliny besides being governor of
Bithynia was intimate with Trajan.</p>

<p>At first sight we may find it strange that all this strenuous devotion
to study produced so little in the way of first-rate original
literature. It is of course customary to ascribe the decline&mdash;assuming
that it was a decline&mdash;of the Golden Age of Augustan literature into the
Silver Latin of Tacitus and Juvenal to the tyranny of emperors like
Tiberius and Nero. It is perfectly true that Tiberius made it dangerous
for senatorial historians to praise the murderers of a Cæsar. But that
is a ludicrously <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_288" id="page_288">{288}</a></span>inadequate explanation for the eclipse of literature.
The experience of Vergil showed that it was possible for a great
loyalist to win fortune and glory amounting to idolisation. The senators
who wanted to continue their school declamations against tyranny were
certainly discouraged, but there was still plenty of room for literary
activity. The truth is, as we have seen, that Augustan literature was
not the work of a young Rome, but of an old and perhaps already
declining Græco-Roman culture. Again it was literary, not political,
causes which led to literary decline. Tacitus, who had for his themes
the conquest of Britain and the wars in Germany and the East, the Siege
of Jerusalem, the burning of Rome, the tragic Year of the Four Emperors,
the crimes and follies of Nero, and the development of the great
imperial system, complains of the lack of interest in the history of his
own times compared with those of the heroic past. The tyranny that
depressed literature was of its own making, the tyranny of convention,
classicism and erudition. To take poetry, though so many noble writers
were toying with the epic, they only produced the pedantic <i>Thebaid</i> of
Statius, the weary <i>Argonauticon</i> of Silius Italicus, an imitation of an
imitation of Homer, and the <i>Pharsalia</i> of Lucan, which, though it
contains many a brilliant epigram and memorable phrase, is to the
majority of mankind almost unreadable. This is simply because Lucan was
consciously pursuing the path which Vergil had pointed out and producing
work which was the logical succession to the style of the <i>Æneid</i>. The
<i>Pharsalia</i> is unmixed declamation, rhetoric shouting at top pitch on
page after page. Vergil had accomplished the literary epic to
perfection: to carry it any further in the same direction was to incur
tediousness. Above all, both Lucan and Silius lacked the greatest of all
Vergil’s gifts, his wonderful ear for verbal music. Vergil, like Milton,
presented his epic diluted for mortal ears with music and human nature.
It was not in the spirit that Lucan failed. He admired the republican
cause and Pompeius, its champion, quite as sincerely as Vergil admired
Augustus or Milton Cromwell. Thus it was not politics, but the literary
gift which caused his failure,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_289" id="page_289">{289}</a></span> at least his failure to hold the ear of
to-day. Past generations have esteemed him high among the world’s poets.
Dante owed not a little to Lucan and Statius as well as to Vergil.</p>

<p>It was only in its lighter forms that poetry continued to make progress.
The <i>Silvæ</i> of Statius, which were shorter occasional poems in elegiac
or lyric measures thrown off at odd moments with ease and rapidity, are
far more interesting than his frigid epic. Martial, the Spanish writer
of <i>vers de société</i>, has a pretty wit that is often surprisingly modern
in its tone. Certainly Juvenal towers over all others who have attempted
satire. Horace had been content with an easy familiarity of tone which
might wheedle a friend into the path of good sense by poking fun at his
follies. Juvenal thunders his denunciations of wickedness with a moral
heat which is surprising in an age often accused of feebleness. He does,
however, resemble Lucan in spoiling some of his effects by want of light
and shade, by a too-persistent flow of rhetoric. He seems unable to
distinguish between harmless follies like playing the flute and real
delinquencies like murdering one’s mother. He clearly draws far too
black a picture of the men and morals of his day. But the pulpit from
which he preaches is a high one.</p>

<p>If Juvenal is supreme over the poets of his time, Tacitus is as clearly
monarch of the prose-writers. He was continuing the work of Livy and
writing from the same republican standpoint. But for history-writing he
had certainly discovered a finer style of rhetoric. Both are
rhetoricians first and historians a long way after, but the packed
epigrams of Tacitus say more in a line than Livy is capable of thinking
in a chapter. In describing a battle, a riot, or a panic, or in painting
some tragic scene, such as the death of Vitellius, Tacitus is
unequalled. The freedom that was permitted to him and Suetonius in
depicting the crimes and follies of the earlier Cæsars affords
remarkable evidence of the freedom of letters under Nerva, Trajan, and
Hadrian. Here, again, it is necessary, as in the case of Juvenal, to
beware of accepting too literally<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_290" id="page_290">{290}</a></span> the severity of his criticisms upon
the preceding generation. To praise the past at the expense of the
present was one of the traditions of Roman literature. But Tacitus was
the last of Rome’s great historians and his loss was irreparable.</p>

<p>All the erudition of the age added little to the real advance of
learning except in the domain of law. Industrious compilers like Pliny
the elder have preserved a great deal of ancient lore for our study, but
they are for the most part utterly uncritical and unscientific. There
were no scientific thinkers like Aristotle in the Roman world. Still,
some text-books which served the Middle Ages for instruction were
produced under the principate, such as Vitruvius on architecture, Strabo
and Pomponius Mela on geography, Columella on agriculture, Quintilian on
rhetoric, and Galen on medicine. The latter was state-physician to
Marcus Aurelius and was employed by him to study and combat the terrible
plague which the Roman army brought back from the East. But for medical
science he added little to his Greek master Hippocrates. In just the
same way, the philosophers came no nearer to the core of reality than
their masters of the fourth and third centuries before Christ, hard
though they toiled and much as they spoke and wrote. They were indeed
learning, what the old Greeks had failed or scorned to learn, how to
apply doctrines to life, but in depth of thought they were so far behind
that they ceased even to be able to comprehend Aristotle. Even Philo,
the profound and learned Jewish philosopher, is doing little more than
to attempt an application of Platonic and other Greek ideas to the
teaching of Moses. Such originality as there was in the world of letters
still proceeded mainly from the provinces. Greece was still putting
forth original contributors to literature like the novelist Lucian, the
biographer and moralist Plutarch, Pausanias the guide-book writer, Dio
Chrysostom and Apollonius the preachers. Africa produced a novelist in
the mysterious quack-magician Apuleius. Spain sent forth a whole galaxy
of talent in the two Senecas, Martial, Lucan, and Quintilian. The
younger Seneca, Nero’s complacent tutor, is</p>

</div>

<p class="nind"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_291" id="page_291">{291}</a></span> perhaps the most typical
figure in the literature of the principate. Trained as a rhetorician,
like all the men of his day, his literary work consists of rhetorical
drama and rhetorical philosophy, including some rhetorical science. No
writer has ever attained to such a position of wealth and honour by the
exercise of his pen. It cannot be said that Seneca’s position was gained
without defilement, or that it brought him happiness. He was largely
responsible by his weak compliance for the deterioration of character in
his imperial pupil. If so, it brought its own retribution, for Nero
drove him to suicide. Though Seneca’s tragedies are neglected to-day,
they formed the connecting-link between Euripides and the stage of the
Renaissance.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the principal defect of thought and literature
under the Empire was its lack of originality. But, after all, that had
always been the deficiency of Roman writers. It was due very largely to
the overwhelming incubus of Greek civilisation, from whose
leading-strings the Romans, to the end of time, never escaped. That in
its turn arose chiefly through the nature of their education which
turned all their attention to <i>style</i> as the end of literary endeavour.
Any one who would argue against a classical education could find no
better argument than the relations between the two “classical” peoples.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Art</span></h3>

<p>With art it is much the same story; for the decoration of their villas
and colonnades the Romans of the Empire continued to prefer their
statues imported from Greece. Pausanias shows us that Greece, even in
the second century <small>A.D.</small>, was still teeming with works of art of every
kind. Impoverished and shrunken as the old Greek cities were at this
period, it shows some high-mindedness that they still retained treasures
which would have fetched millions in the Trans-Adriatic markets. There
was, however, a brisk trade in copies and imitations of the
masterpieces. For statues, then, the Greek work of the fifth and fourth
centuries almost destroyed any attempt at<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_292" id="page_292">{292}</a></span> originality by the Romans.
Only in portraiture was there much progress, and here work of great
power and vigour was produced. It reaches the zenith perhaps under the
Flavian emperors, but their successors of the Antonine period and later
are often depicted on their busts with triumphant but unsparing realism.
The bust of Philip the Arabian in the Vatican is one of the most
striking. Sometimes it almost seems as if there was a malicious spirit
of caricature in these too faithful portraits. Can Marcus Aurelius, the
philosopher prince, have presented to the world a visage so weak and so
tonsorially perfect?<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> Can Caracalla have borne his bloody mind so
visibly written on his face?<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> In portraiture, there is certainly
progress and not decay.</p>

<p>Otherwise, to judge by the remains, sculptors were almost confined to
bas-relief. This was the medium chosen by emperor after emperor for the
narration of his exploits, and advances were unquestionably made in the
art of pictorial or narrative sculpture. That this is a high art in
itself may, I think, be contested. One cannot escape from a sense of the
practical futility of telling the history of the Dacian Wars on a
serpentine band of ornament which soared away out of sight. It is rather
characteristic of the plodding Roman, who so often lost sight of the
wood in his faithful contemplation of the trees. If we look for the end
to which this art of narrative relief was tending, we shall find it on
the basis of the column of Antoninus Pius preserved in the Vatican
garden.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> These cavalrymen placidly gyrating round the group of
standard-bearers, each on his own little shelf, are so extremely
life-like as to recall nothing in the world so much as pieces of
gingerbreads. We begin to perceive that Madame Tussaud would have been
hailed as a great creative artist in Imperial Rome. Nevertheless,
without subscribing to all the superlatives of Mrs. Strong, we may admit
that Art was still alive and vigorous and still scoring fresh technical
triumphs in the Antonine period and even later.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_293" id="page_293">{293}</a></span></p>

POMPEII: TWO VIEWS OF THE RUINS</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Roman archæologists have recently worked out the history of Imperial Art
with some precision. The reign of Tiberius continued the classical
tendencies of Augustus. Under Claudius there was great constructional
activity, mainly of a utilitarian character. The Claudian aqueduct,
whose immense arches in brick still break the level horizon of the
Campagna, is one of the greatest works of this period.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> Nero’s was an
age of Greek curio-hunting; much of Rome was rebuilt after the great
fire in his reign and the Golden House must have been a stupendous
sight. But on his death the Romans made haste to obliterate all traces
of his work. The Flavian epoch was the culminating-point of Roman art.
Vespasian destroyed Nero’s Golden House and restored the Capitol. He and
his sons built the baths of Titus, the Arch of Titus<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> with the
celebrated Jewish relief, and the mighty Flavian Amphitheatre, the
Colosseum.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> This was built in the style already noticed in the
theatre of Marcellus, namely, with the three Greek orders of
architecture, Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian, adorning the three stories
of the façade; but here, as so often, the Greek façade is a mere shell
to hide the solid Roman masonry of which the building is really
constructed. It is noteworthy that the monuments of this age refute the
historians who allege among Domitian’s other sins that he tried to
destroy the works and the memory of Titus, his more popular brother. In
the technical language of Wickhoff, this Flavian Age shows us
“illusionism” at its height in art. Under Trajan, and in his famous
column, the art of continuous narration in low relief is fully
developed.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> Hadrian, the cultured, travelling Philhellene, encouraged
a reversion to the classical traditions of Greek art. The art of his
period was profoundly influenced by the type of Antinous, a beautiful
youth beloved by the emperor, whose romantic death by drowning in the
Nile made a powerful impression upon the whole Roman world, because he
was believed to have sacrificed his life for his emperor’s in obedience
to an oracle. This type is preserved for us in many forms, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_294" id="page_294">{294}</a></span> most
notably in the colossal Mondragore bust in the Louvre<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> and the
bas-relief in the Villa Albani.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> His features were utilised to
represent all the young male gods on Olympus. In their tragic beauty we
see a mirror of Greece tinged by the Orient, as if Dionysus had wedded
Isis and this were the offspring. The Antonine period, as exhibited on
the panels in the Palazzo dei Conservatori, is gifted with immense
technical fluency and, as Mrs. Strong remarks, a new spiritual
seriousness. As compositions they are superb, but the weakness of
expression in the face of Marcus Aurelius himself quite spoils their
effect for some spectators.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>Architecture was still mainly designed in the three Greek modes
variously combined, in spite of the fact that Rome had progressed far
beyond Greek limits in constructional ability. Roman builders could
manage a roof-span far in excess of the Greeks. The Roman arch gave a
strength in concrete vaulting which expensive marble was unable to
attain. Roman brickwork denuded of the marble incrustations which
generally covered it of old is probably more impressive in its ruins
than it was when it was draped with Hellenism, and, to me at least,
remains like the aqueduct at Pont du Gard<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> and the Bridge of
Alcantara<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> seem truer witnesses of the grandeur of Rome than all the
marbles in all the museums. The celebrated Castle of St. Angelo, which
still keeps watch and ward over the Tiber, is nothing but the core of
Hadrian’s tomb&mdash;the <i>Moles Hadriani</i>&mdash;once clad in a vestment of Greek
marbles and covered with Greek ornament.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> The Pantheon, in spite of
the inscription which ascribes it to Agrippa, is proved by the marks on
its bricks to be a restoration of Hadrian’s time. It is indeed a superb
example of vaulting and a miracle of construction. The plan is that of a
dome so constructed that if the sphere were complete it would rest upon
the earth. The magnificent interior has lost little of its ancient
splendour.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>For temple architecture, although the Romans had adopted<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_295" id="page_295">{295}</a></span> the forms of
Greek art they had wholly deserted the spirit of austere self-restraint
upon which that art had rested. Thus they readily adopted the luxuriance
of the East when it came to hand. In the splendid ruins of Heliopolis
(Ba’albek) and Palmyra we see a riotous luxuriance of ornament which
would have shocked the religious sense of Ictinus, but which fitly
enshrined the ritual and mysteries of the Sungod. This craze for the
colossal would have made the reverential Greeks tremble in fear of
provoking the Nemesis of a jealous Heaven, but in its ruins it has left
us superb and awful reminders of the riches and grandeur of its authors,
and of the end of all riches and grandeur.</p>

<p>In domestic building the Romans had almost as little regard as the
Greeks for the exterior elevation of their villas and palaces. The Roman
gentleman still made it his favourite hobby to collect villas, and Pliny
had almost as many as Cicero. But the main idea of the villa was
comfort, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_296" id="page_296">{296}</a></span> main idea of Roman comfort was coolness, quiet, and
beautiful scenery. Thus the wealthy man’s house consisted of a series of
marble courts and cloisters spread over the ground regardless of space.
Landscape and landscape-gardening were the most charming features. The
Roman appreciated the scenery of Como or Sirmione, Tivoli or Naples
quite as keenly as the tourist of to-day. He thought much of fresh air
and good water. Nearly all Roman gentlemen were agreed in considering
Rome itself, with its smells, its noise, and its perils by fire, as a
pestilent place of abode, and they gladly fled to their country estates
at Præneste or Baiæ. Hadrian’s villa at Tivoli<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> included
reproductions of many famous buildings which he had seen and admired on
his travels. The decoration of these villas encouraged two minor arts
which figure prominently among their remains. The floors were commonly
adorned with marble mosaic, of which we still have some charming
examples.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> The interior walls were incrusted either with marble, in
the wealthier houses, or stuccoed and painted. Hence, it results that
the Art of Painting is represented to us almost solely by mosaics,
wall-frescoes,<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> and a few portraits on Egyptian mummy-cases. Nothing
remains of the great masters of antiquity, Polygnotus, Zeuxis, and
Apelles. But there may be faint echoes of their work on the frescoes of
Pompeii executed by unnamed decorators. Even so there is great charm in
much of this work. Professor Mau, the great authority on Pompeii, has
distinguished four successive phases of painting in that city. At first
the aim was to imitate the marble slabs used to cover the walls of the
rich man’s house. Then growing bolder the painter imitates various forms
of architectural treatment dividing up his wall space into panels and
portraying cornices, columns, pilasters, and so forth. This is roughly
the style of the first century <small>B.C.</small>, and it is found in the so-called
house of Livia on the Palatine Hill at Rome.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> The third style, which
Mau terms the “ornate,” was prevalent until about <small>A.D.</small> 50.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_297" id="page_297">{297}</a></span></p>

<p class="nind">The architectural features now make no pretence at illusion. The columns
have become mere bands of colour, and there is profuse ornament
everywhere. The colours are somewhat cold. The fourth or “intricate”
style once more emphasises the architectural character of the
decoration, but the patterns are too intricate to present any appearance
of reality. The whole wall space shows a riot of fantastic ornament
often extremely graceful and effective. Flying goddesses and cupids
impart a sense of airy lightness, and floral forms festoon themselves in
charming curves. The pictures are smaller and the spaces wider. No more
pleasing treatment of the interior walls of a house has ever been
devised, at any rate for warm climates. The destruction of Pompeii by
the eruption of Vesuvius in a.d. 79 brings the history of ancient
painting to a premature close.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> The subjects of the pictures are
almost exclusively mythological.</p>

<p>The minor arts of the jeweller, the gem-engraver, the goldsmith reach a
high state of technical perfection, but they do not improve in spirit or
artistic feeling with the progress of the ages. Much of the furniture
found at Pompeii and Herculaneum, especially the bronze-work,<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>
exhibits most graceful forms, always Greek in inspiration.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Law</span></h3>

<p>The greatest intellectual achievement of the Roman people was in the
domain of law. The spiritual endowment of the typical Roman included all
the qualities of the lawyer&mdash;a sense of equity that was quite devoid of
sentimentalism, an instinct for order, discipline, and business, a
language of great clarity and precision, and above all, a devotion to
ceremonies and formulæ which sternly rejected abstract casuistry. Their
law took its rise in a series of religious formulæ known only to priests
and to the king as chief priest. The Twelve Tables put some of the most
ancient principles into words, and partly from their use as a text-book
of education, were regarded almost with<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_298" id="page_298">{298}</a></span> as much veneration as the Two
Tables of Moses. They were, in fact, sometimes considered as the sole
fountain of jurisprudence, or at any rate as the sole code of written
law. The legislative enactments of the State were on a far lower plane
and no ancient people ever considered its legislature capable of turning
out a daily quota of legislation as modern parliaments are supposed to
do. In the main the fabric of Roman jurisprudence consisted of “case
law” made by the judges on the tribunals. The Prætor Urbanus made the
Civil Law of Rome, and this became permanent by means of the system of
Perpetual Edicts. Religion continued to control the international law of
the Roman world, an affair of ceremonies in the hands of the priestly
college of heralds&mdash;the <i>jus fetiale</i>. But, meanwhile, the <i>prætor
peregrinus</i> who had to decide cases between non-citizens was gradually
accumulating a body of law, wrongly termed international, in the <i>jus
gentium</i>. It was observed that there was a great deal in common between
the various codes of the Italian and other Mediterranean States, and
this was put together in the foreign prætor’s edict. The more
philosophical jurists, inspired with the Stoic doctrines about following
nature, evolved the theory that this common element of various nations
was nothing but the Natural Law, <i>jus naturæ</i>. It was a fruitful error,
and it lies at the base of much of the modern “international law” as
expounded by Grotius and other seventeenth-century jurists.</p>

<p>The Civil Law of Rome was in the main, then, a series of precedents
handed down by prætor to prætor from times beyond record. To it was
added a large body of “counsel’s opinions” which drew their validity
largely from the eminence of their authors. It was Hadrian who set about
the systematisation of these. He organised the <i>jurisprudentes</i> into a
regular profession. He appointed his “counsellors” from the leading
barristers of the day, and he gave to the whole body of <i>responsa
prudentium</i>, “the opinions of the learned,” the validity of statutory
law. The justice and precision of the civil law was the most attractive
feature of Roman civilisation to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_299" id="page_299">{299}</a></span> barbarian world. Gallic and
British communities made haste to learn Latin in order that they might
gain the “Latin right” which admitted them to the privilege of enjoying
Roman law. In <small>A.D.</small> 212, Caracalla, who did little else to deserve the
gratitude of posterity, uttered a single edict called the “Antonine
Constitution” which admitted the whole empire to the privileges of Roman
citizenship. Now a single code ran throughout the whole Western world.
Hadrian had set his most distinguished lawyers, under the leadership of
Salvius Julianus, to codify the “perpetual edict” of the prætors. It was
under the Antonines that some citizen from the East, who is only known
to us by the common prænomen of Gaius, wrote those learned “Institutes
of Roman Law” which are still the nursery of our lawyers. But it was the
great Eastern emperor Justinian (<small>A.D.</small> 527-565) who codified the whole
body of civil law in a series of immense documents. Roman law had
already conquered its barbarian conquerors, the Goths, and almost every
European legal system except our own is based upon that ancient law
which arose from the Twelve Tables and the prætor’s edict. The canon law
of the Church was Roman law in its essence.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Philosophy and Religion</span></h3>

<p>Much attention has been paid in recent years to the religious
development of the Romans under the Empire, and to the momentous
conflict of religions which was going on from the age of Hadrian until
the final triumph of Christianity. Humanly speaking, it was “touch and
go” between several religions competing for the vacant place in the
faith of the Empire, and at the last the strife was practically narrowed
down to a duel between two oriental monotheistic systems, Mithraism<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>
and Christianity. The subject is too vast for anything like adequate
treatment here. But I would emphasise one point of view which is often
overlooked.</p>

<p>The Roman state is too often regarded merely as the enemy<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_300" id="page_300">{300}</a></span> and
persecutor of the Christian religion. It is forgotten how large a share
Rome may claim in its establishment. Not only did the Romans discover
Christianity, but they organised it and sent it forth conquering and to
conquer in the wake of the legions. It is not a case of a wicked and
corrupt people suddenly converted in the midst of its sins. On the
contrary it is easy to show that the thinkers of the Roman Empire were
tending towards philosophic and religious ideas which made them ready to
accept with astonishing rapidity both the ethical teaching and the
theological revelations of the Son of God. It is unnecessary to remind
the modern reader how large a part the Greek philosophy of Stoicism with
its Roman modifications had played in shaping the thoughts of one Roman
citizen, Paul of Tarsus. Philo, the Alexandrian Platonist, had developed
a doctrine of the Divine <i>Logos</i>, which profoundly influenced the
philosophy of the fourth Evangelist, and through him the whole course of
Christian teaching.</p>

<p>The Romans may have added little to abstract philosophy or to
metaphysics, but they made the somewhat barren abstractions of Zeno the
Stoic into something more than a philosophy, into a faith which had a
power to influence conduct far beyond the power of the State system of
half-Greek Olympian Gods. If the power and the sincerity of a religion
may be tested rather by its martyrs than by its proselytes, Stoicism had
a worthy record. Men like Thrasea Pætus, Helvidius Priscus, and Barea
Soranus were facing the tyrant’s frown for the sake of their Stoic sense
of duty, just as truly as Peter and Polycarp.</p>

<p>The attitude of the Roman Government towards Christianity has been too
often explained to need more than a brief recapitulation. At first
Christianity was confounded with Judaism, which had already begun to
make converts at Rome without seeking for them. The Roman government was
extraordinarily tolerant towards creed, but it demanded an external
compliance with the Cæsar-worship, which it was imposing on the
provinces as a test of loyalty. But the Christians did not take the
divine command “render unto</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_301" id="page_301">{301}</a></span> Cæsar the things that are Cæsar’s” to
include scattering incense on his altars. Too many of them had been
brought up in the punctilious exclusiveness of the Jewish tradition for
them to display on such points the laxity which is sometimes called
broad-mindedness. Even in the private intercourse of social life the
Christians were unpleasantly apt to insist upon their scruples. The meat
in the butchers’ shops had often been slain in sacrifice, and the
Christian conscience revolted at “meat offered to idols.” The libation
with which the wine-cup started on its rounds was another offence to the
tender monotheistic conscience. These things made the Christians
unpopular. Their close associations, their secret meetings and
love-feasts, the communism which they practised, all aroused the
suspicions which are begotten of mystery. Lastly, their conviction that
the Second Coming and the Day of Judgment were at hand made them ardent
proselytes. It made them utter prognostications of death and damnation
to all around them, and to see apocalyptic visions of the fall of the
kingdoms of this earth. Such prophecies were sometimes misunderstood as
involving treasonable designs. The first persecution under Nero was
largely the result of such suspicions.</p>

<p>But the official attitude of the permanent Roman Government is probably
revealed in the famous correspondence between Pliny and his emperor,
Trajan. Imperial Rome is not to set up an inquisition. No man is to be
punished for his faith, but if he is accused to the governor and is
obstinate in refusing to pay the obeisance demanded by the state he is
to be punished for his contumacy. That is precisely the attitude which
the most humane and enlightened Christian states have adopted towards
heresy. Later, when the Faith grew in importance, and when it even
reached the point of soldiers refusing the military oaths, occasional
emperors, often the better emperors, strove to fight against it. Then
there were sometimes inquisitions and wholesale martyrdoms as under
Decius and Diocletian. But no martyrdom, however public or agonising,
could quench the faith of those who saw the heavens opening and the
Angels of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_302" id="page_302">{302}</a></span> God descending with their crowns of glory. The publicity of
the scenes and the constancy of the victims increased, as usual, the
number of the converts. Foolish magistrates sought to encounter
obstinacy with further severity, and the Faith only grew the more
abundantly. It was not so much his personal conversion&mdash;for that was
tardy and half-hearted&mdash;as the motive of policy to secure an advantage
over Maxentius, which induced Constantine to promulgate the Edict of
Milan in 313, by which toleration was extended to the Christian faith
throughout the Roman Empire.</p>

<p>We must not be surprised that the best emperors, including the
philosopher and saint, Marcus Aurelius, were the most bitterly hostile
to Christianity. That is human nature. Stoic philosophers were teaching
very much in common with Christian philosophy, but that renders it all
the less likely that Stoic philosophers should be among the converts.
Nevertheless Christian doctrine, especially in the Græco-Jewish
communities of Asia Minor, was falling on prepared soil. The Stoic
paradoxes had undoubtedly prepared the way for the Christian paradoxes.
The doctrines of humility and asceticism were a commonplace of the
Cynics. “No Cross, no Crown,” “He who would save his life must lose
it”&mdash;such sayings as these would gain immediate assent from thoughtful
Romans. Epictetus, a heathen slave of Domitian’s day, wrote his answer
to the tyrant: “No man hath power over me. I have been set free by God.
I know His Commandments; henceforth no man can lead me captive.” The
Stoics were daily teaching that it is hard for a rich man to enter into
the Kingdom of God. This is the creed of Marcus Aurelius: “To venerate
the gods and bless them, and to do good to men, and to practise
tolerance and self-restraint.” The horrors of the amphitheatre are one
side of imperial society. But on the other side Musonius Rufus, a Stoic
who stood high in the favour of Vespasian and Titus, went among the
soldiers to preach against militarism. Slave-drivers as the Romans were,
they were beginning to feel a sense of the brotherhood of man.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="nind"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_303" id="page_303">{303}</a></span> Seneca
was calling the slaves “humble friends.” “Man is a holy thing to man,”
he says; and such teaching was reflected even in the legislation of the
day. Juvenal pleads passionately for kindness to slaves and for moral
purity in the home. Seneca not only feels that men are brothers, but
that God is the Father of us all. We have seen how public charity was
finding expression in the <i>alimenta</i> and the free schools. “Love them
that hate you” would not strike the Romans of the second century as
anything more than a strong expression of the truth they had already
begun to recognise. Thus the practical side of Christian ethics found
its harmonies in the conduct as well as the theory of the more
enlightened pagans. Peace and humanitarianism were in the air of the
Antonine Age.</p>

<p>As for religious dogma the whole tendency of thought was towards
monotheism. “God is a Spirit” would find an instant acquiescence among
educated Romans, even though they frequented the temples of a hundred
different gods. Philosophy among Greeks and Romans alike had always been
monotheistic. On the subject of immortality the philosophers were
divided. Marcus Aurelius and Seneca are on the whole not hopeful.
Probably the beliefs of the common folk&mdash;as testified in the epitaphs of
their cemeteries&mdash;were equally divided. The laconic epitaph: “I was not,
I was: I am not, I care not,” is common. But other epitaphs equally
common express the hope of reunions in the other world or even of being
“received among the number of the gods.” But on the whole the commonest
view of Death was as a happy release and an unending sleep. It was the
immediate hope of eternal bliss, which was the greatest thing that
Christianity had to offer to the pagan world.</p>

<p>Rome, then, was in many ways prepared for the reception of Christianity,
whose doctrines found an echo in the aspirations of the day. She did
much to give to Christian theology its Western form, and of course the
ritual and practice of the Roman Church was in many ways merely a
continuation of old<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_304" id="page_304">{304}</a></span> pagan rites and ceremonies. Ancient deities became
Christian saints without change of rite or cult; images were often
adapted and even names scarcely altered. But, in fact, the whole
conception of that mighty Church which conquered the world, including
the barbarian invaders, was the offspring of the Roman political system.
It was her genius for statecraft which made Rome the Eternal City. In
one form or another she has governed the world for twenty centuries.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_305" id="page_305">{305}</a></span></p>

/></span> SHOULD have preferred to leave the Roman world at the
height of its grandeur, when the whole vast territory was enjoying
prosperity, if not peace, under the virtuous and benevolent Antonines.
In that way this book would best create the true impression of Rome, not
as a lamentable failure, but as the conspicuous success which it
assuredly was. But as the reader will probably follow the old Greek
maxim and desire to see the end before recording a judgment, a few pages
are added containing a very brief summary of the closing scenes. It is
necessary to notice that even the closing scenes cover a period of two
hundred years, and that this progress is not even yet entirely downhill.
They include good and bad reigns, periods of prosperity as well as
disaster.</p>

<p>Here again the impression of pessimism which we get from reading the
account of the Empire is due to the historians as much as to the
history. Lampridius and the other writers of the Augustan History are
small-minded writers who label the various princes as good or bad
largely according to their treatment of the senate. The Augustan
historians are trained in the school of Suetonius, they dwell upon
gossip and can form no large political judgments. Very little of the
gossip is authentic. If they have decided to revile an emperor they<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_306" id="page_306">{306}</a></span>
repeat the scandals narrated by Suetonius about Tiberius or Nero. It is
only in their accounts of military action that they can be trusted, and
this fact creates a false preponderance of warfare in the annals of the
period.</p>

<p>The succession to the imperial throne continued to be the weak point of
the whole system. The throne itself passed through unspeakable
degradations. The guards who murdered Pertinax formally put the
succession up to auction in the prætorian camp. Septimius Severus
(193-198) gave a brief respite of strong government which almost
destroyed the fiction of senatorial authority, for Severus held the
proconsular power even over Rome and Italy. Caracalla was probably the
worst of all the emperors in personal vice and brutality, but he was the
author of that famous decree which conferred the citizenship on all the
western provinces. In Elagabalus (218-222) Rome had for master the vile
and effeminate priest of the Sungod, who brought the fetish-stone of
Emesa into the city and attempted to make all the gods bow down to it.
Alexander Severus was a blameless prince, and Maximin the Thracian drove
the barbarians back behind the <i>limites</i> of the Rhine and Danube. After
the Gordians the senate enjoyed for a brief space the opportunity of
governing Rome through their nominee Pupienus, but the disorders of the
period may be gauged from the fact that in the eighteen years following
Alexander Severus, who died in 235, twelve persons wore the purple. Then
Gallienus assumed it, having for his colleague that Valerian who was the
first of Roman emperors to be taken prisoner by the enemy. Strange and
horrible tales hung about his mysterious fate when taken captive by
Shapur, the Persian king. In the latter years of Gallienus the Empire
was practically divided, for his rebellious general Postumus was
recognised as emperor throughout Gaul, Spain, and Britain. In this
period, too, Palmyra rose into independent power as the meeting-place of
the caravan routes across the Syrian plains. Under the famous Queen
Zenobia it practically ruled over the eastern parts of the Empire, and
its splendid ruins prove its wealth and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_307" id="page_307">{307}</a></span> magnificence. Gallienus then
almost allowed the Empire to disintegrate under his feeble grasp, but
his successor Claudius Gothicus (268) was a man and a soldier. He smote
the Goths and would have restored the Empire in full, but the plague,
which had never wholly disappeared since the time of Marcus Aurelius,
carried him off in the third year of his reign. The task was left for
Aurelian, that Pannonian peasant whose brilliant generalship hurled back
the enemy on every side, while his statesmanship restored the authority
of the emperor and even the financial credit of the Empire. The mighty
wall with which he surrounded Rome is, however, a sad testimony of the
dark days upon which the imperial city had fallen. The Palmyrene kingdom
was defeated and the rich city plundered. The rebel Empire of the Gauls
was destroyed for ever. The grandest triumph ever witnessed in Rome was
that of Aurelian in 274. It is thus described by Vopiscus:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“There were three royal chariots. One was that of Odenathus,
brilliant with jewellery in gold, silver, and gems; the second,
similarly constructed, was the gift of the Persian king to
Aurelian; the third was the design of Zenobia herself, who hoped to
visit Rome in it. Wherein she was not deceived, for she entered the
city in it after her defeat. There was another chariot yoked to
four stags, which is said to have belonged to the king of the
Goths. On this Aurelian rode to the Capitol, there to sacrifice the
stags which he had vowed to Jupiter the Highest and Mightiest.
Twenty elephants went before, tamed beasts of Libya and two hundred
different beasts from Palestine, which Aurelian immediately
presented to private individuals in order that the treasury might
not be burdened with their maintenance. Four tigers, giraffes,
elks, and other creatures were led in procession. Eight hundred
pairs of gladiators, as well as captives from the barbarian tribes,
Blemyes, Axiomitæ, Arabs, Eudæmones, Ludians, Bactrians, Hiberi,
Saracens, Persians, all with their various treasures; Goths, Alani,
Roxolani, Sarmatians, Franks, Suevi, Vandals, Germans advanced as
captives with their hands bound. Among them also were the Palmyrene
chiefs, who survived, and the Egyptian rebels. Ten women whom
Aurelian had taken fighting in male attire among the Goths were in
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_308" id="page_308">{308}</a></span> procession, while many of these ‘Amazons’ had been slain. In
front of each contingent a placard bearing the name of the tribe
was carried. Among them was Tetricus (the ‘emperor’ of the Gallic
Empire) in a scarlet cloak, a yellow tunic, and Gallic breeches.
There walked Zenobia too, laden with jewels and chained with gold
chains which others carried. In front of the conquered princes
their crowns were borne along labelled with their names. And next
the Roman People followed, the banners of the guilds and camps, the
mailed soldiers, the royal spoils, the whole army and the senate
(although it was saddened to see that some members of its body were
among the captives) added much to the splendour of the show. It was
not until the ninth hour that the Capitol was reached, and the
palace much later.”</p></div>

<p>Aurelian endeavoured to establish Mithraism as the state religion, and
earned the gratitude of the vulgar by supplementing the free supply of
corn with a daily ration of pork. Oil and salt were given gratuitously,
and he even prepared to supply free wine. The three emperors who
succeeded Aurelian, Tacitus, Probus, and Carus, were men of good
character, and the first two were, once more, the nominees of the
senate.</p>

<p>Throughout this troubled age the causes of confusion were twofold. On
the one hand the Empire itself was so vast and scattered that it tended
now to fall to pieces of its own momentum, as the seedbox opens to
scatter its seeds. Britain, Gaul, Germany, Palmyra&mdash;each in its turn
began to feel a unity of its own. Rome was far away, and the government
was often weak and negligent. Here was an opportunity for the local
generals to carve out thrones for themselves. While the emperor hurried
this way and that fresh rebellions broke out in his rear. It was no
one’s fault in particular. The world-state was impossible in theory as
in practice. It was only possible while the provinces were barbarian.
When they became civilised and self-conscious they were bound to feel
their natural unity.</p>

</div>

<p>In the second place, the barbarians were now grown to full<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_309" id="page_309">{309}</a></span> stature.
They were no longer quarrelsome tribes which could be turned against one
another by adroit statecraft, but nations much less barbarous than of
old, with some organisation and a purpose above that of mere plunder. No
artificial ramparts could hold them. It is very doubtful whether even
the legions of Rome at their best could have resisted these repeated
assaults on all sides. The first great inroad across the Danube took
place in the reign of M. Aurelius. It was crushed, as the column of that
emperor depicts, and Sarmatia and Marcomannia were added as short-lived
provinces. It is in the third century that we begin to hear of the
greater barbarian nations, or groups of tribes, of the Alemanni and the
Suevi, the Franks, the Saxons, the Goths, and the Vandals. Battle after
battle was fought and triumph after triumph won against them, but they
still pressed on. The weaker emperors essayed to buy them with gold, the
wiser with land, the craftier set them to slay one another, but still
they moved forward resistlessly, wave after wave, like the sea. This
again was nobody’s fault. It may have been the movement of Tartar
savages in the Far East which set the Wandering of the Nations in
motion. Whatever it was, all eastern and northern Europe was seething
with restless movement and the tide rolled on irresistibly against the
bulwarks of civilisation. Triumphs as great and glorious as those of
Scipio and Marius were gained by Roman armies even in the fourth
century. But the enemy was ubiquitous, the task impossible.</p>

<p>It is, however, true that those bulwarks were weaker than they should
have been, partly by reason of the internal disorganisation caused by
perpetual struggles for the succession, and partly through certain
visible errors in Roman statesmanship. For one thing, the spirit of
peace and humanity which was ripening in the securer central parts of
the Empire had probably impaired its instincts of defence. The modern
world is trying just now to believe that you can retain the power of
defence when you have given up all thoughts of aggression. It may be so.
The Roman world failed in the attempt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_310" id="page_310">{310}</a></span> Rome’s statesmen were now no
longer soldiers, but lawyers and financiers. Even the prefects of the
prætorian guard were lawyers. The army was a profession apart. Moreover,
even the army had become so civilised that it had lost many of its
martial qualities. Hadrian more than any other ruler is responsible for
allowing the <i>cannabæ</i> or “booths” which had sprung up around the camps
to grow into towns and even cities. The legions were now permanently
established in their quarters, the soldiers married wives and occupied
their leisure in business or husbandry. Hadrian it was, too, who in his
large cosmopolitan spirit had introduced many and doubtless useful
barbarian methods of fighting, so that the old Roman military traditions
had fallen into desuetude. A legion was now no better than its
auxiliaries. The auxiliaries were often barbarians and soon the legions
themselves became completely barbarised. It was only a step further when
barbarians were recruited in tribes to fight Rome’s battles under their
own commanders.</p>

<p>Secondly, the whole Roman world was being slowly strangled with good
intentions. The bureaucracy had grown so highly organised and efficient,
so nicely ordered through its various grades of official life, that
everybody walked in leading-strings to the music of official
proclamations. Paternalism regulated everything with its watchful and
benignant eye. The triumph of the system may be seen in the famous Edict
of Prices issued by Diocletian in <small>A.D.</small> 301. Here we find scheduled a
maximum price for every possible commodity of trade and a maximum wage
for every kind of service. Death is the penalty for any trader who asks,
or any purchaser who pays a higher price. No difference of locality or
season is permitted. Trade is forbidden to fluctuate under penalty of
death. This delightful scheme, which was engraved on stone in every
market in Europe, was evidently the product of a highly efficient Board
of Trade, which had sat late of nights over the study of statistics and
political economy. Benevolent officials of this type swarmed all over
the empire, spying and reporting on one another as well as on the
general public.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_311" id="page_311">{311}</a></span></p>

<p>The same system of blear-eyed officialism had found a still more
ingenious method of throttling the society which it was endeavouring to
nurse back into infancy. It was under Severus Alexander (about <small>A.D.</small> 230)
that the various <i>collegia</i> or guilds were incorporated by charter, so
that every industry whatever became a close corporation. This rendered
the task of administration much simpler. It meant that every human
occupation became hereditary. There was, for example, a guild of the
<i>coloni</i> or tillers of the soil. The most benevolent of the emperors,
Marcus Aurelius and the two Severi, had planted barbarians on Roman soil
under condition of military service in lieu of rent. This service became
hereditary also. Before long each piece of ground had to supply a
recruit. The <i>decuriones</i>, moreover, or municipal senators, who had once
been the honoured magistrates of their townships, also became a caste.
As they were made responsible for the collection of property tax in
their boroughs, and as wealth began to decline and taxation to increase,
they were reduced to a condition of penury and misery. The exemption
from taxation of whole classes of society, such as the soldiers and
eventually the Christian clergy, added to their burdens. Then, since
many of them attempted to evade the distresses entailed upon their rank
by joining the army or even selling themselves into slavery, a decree
was issued which made their office hereditary. It became a form of
punishment to enrol an offender among these <i>curiales</i>. A decree of
Constantine bound all the tillers of the soil in hereditary bondage for
ever. In these ways Roman society fell into stagnation. Since the
progress of the Manchurian Empire in China proceeded on very similar
lines, it looks as if the benevolent despotism engendered by highly
centralised government of very large areas was one of the methods by
which Providence is accustomed to bring great empires low.</p>

<p>At the close of the third century Diocletian endeavoured to save the
state by a bold revolution. He swept away the hollow pretence of
republicanism and frankly surrounded the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_312" id="page_312">{312}</a></span> throne with every circumstance
of majesty and ceremony. The free access which had generally been
granted by the most despotic princes was replaced by an elaborate system
of intermediaries. To meet the obvious needs of devolution in
government, as well as to stop the incessant struggles for the
succession, he invented an ingenious division of responsibility.
Henceforth there were to be two Augusti, one taking the East and one the
West. The Empire was not actually divided, for the joint writ of the two
colleagues was to run all over it. Moreover each Augustus was to have a
junior colleague, a “Cæsar,” acting as his lieutenant and prepared to
step into his place. Ties of marriage were to unite all four into one
close family alliance. There were now one hundred and sixteen provinces
and Diocletian grouped them into thirteen “dioceses” each under a
“vicar,” directly responsible to one of four “prætorian prefects,” who
shared the administration of the whole. The troops were no longer
subject to the provincial governors, but each army had a “Duke” (<i>dux</i>)
of its own. Each frontier&mdash;and these were still further fortified&mdash;was
under its own “Duke.” At the same time steps were taken to organise a
central striking force&mdash;the <i>comitatus</i> of the emperors. The four
Prefectures and thirteen Dioceses were as follows:</p>

<p class="nind">Italy, it will be observed, has now definitely declined into the status
of a province among many, and Rome itself was not sufficiently near the
frontier armies to be a convenient capital. Diocletian preferred to make
his residence at Nicomedia. The senate, as a necessary consequence,
receded into the background, and remained little more than a title of
dignity. The emperor’s Consistory, a privy council composed of the heads
of departments, took its place for practical purposes. The new
hierarchy<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_313" id="page_313">{313}</a></span> of officials rejoiced in barbaric titles which would have
shocked the ears of a genuine Roman.</p>

</div>

<p>Naturally these advances in the direction of more and stronger
government proved no alleviation of the woes which sprang from too much
supervision. The most visible sign of decay was the decline of
population which began to lay the central parts of the Empire desolate,
and this sprang not only from economic burdens, but from racial decline.
Money became so debased and worthless that the world actually went back
to the system of barter.</p>

<p>Constantine signalised Diocletian’s plan of dividing the responsibility
of government by founding a new capital at Byzantium. His motives were
probably mixed. In the first place he would be free of the awkward
republican traditions which still kept reasserting themselves, and in
the second place Constantinople was a more central and a much more
defensible situation. But, more than all, in this new Rome he could
break away from the old religion. Constantine’s plan for restoring the
tired and afflicted world was the adoption of Christianity. The Decree
of Milan (313) made Christianity the official religion, though not the
only religion, of the Empire. It was already the religion of the
court&mdash;ever since Constantine had seen his famous vision of the Angel
descending from Heaven with the sign of the Cross and uttering the words
ἐν τούτω νίκα&mdash;“Hoc signo vinces.” Still half-pagan, the emperor had
made the Cross his mascot, and in the strength of it had defeated his
rival at the Milvian Bridge just outside Rome.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> Constantine himself
was by no means a saint; in murdering kinsmen he was, in fact, among the
worst of the emperors, but unwittingly he saved the world by his
conversion. Meanwhile the extravagance with which he adorned his new
city afflicted the whole Empire with the burdens of fresh taxations.</p>

<p>The scheme of a divided Empire failed. After Theodosius (395) the
division became permanent. The Eastern throne remained secure for
another thousand years, protected by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_314" id="page_314">{314}</a></span> admirable strategic position
of Constantinople. The contempt with which it has hitherto been treated
by historians is now beginning to break down, and it is seen that the
Byzantine Empire not only stood as the bulwark for the West against the
East but preserved for us the inestimable treasures of Greek intellect.
The Roman tradition, now inextricably mingled with the Greek, lingered
on there unchanged, even to the very chariot-races which still threw
society into a ferment. To this day the inhabitants of Greece and
Roumania distinguish themselves from their oriental neighbours by the
proud title of “Romans.”</p>

<p>But in the West a series of phantoms succeeded one another upon the
throne. The floodgates of the Rhine and Danube frontiers broke down
completely and the new nations streamed into their heritage. Then it was
found how truly Constantine’s policy had saved the world. Though the
Goths took and plundered Rome (410), they came in not as pagan
destroyers, but as Christian immigrants, and it was Gothic generals and
Gothic armies who saved Europe from destruction. About 447 the Mongolian
Huns under their terrible Attila came riding into western Europe from
the steppes of Russia. They crossed the Rhine half a million strong,
destroying and burning as they came. The Roman emperor’s sister Honoria
proposed marriage to Attila, and the proud barbarian offered her a place
in his harem if she would bring half the Western Empire as her dowry.
The Roman general Aetius with a half-barbarian army in alliance with the
Visigoths checked them at “The Battle of Chalons” and the peril drifted
away. Aetius who had saved Rome was stabbed by his ungrateful emperor.</p>

<p>The Vandals had already overrun Spain and streamed across to Africa,
whence they issued forth to make a second sack of Rome. Britain had been
deserted rather by the choice of its army than by command of any
emperor, and left a prey to the pagans of the north in 406. Italy itself
was wholly in the hands of the barbarians, who lived on terms of
apparent</p>

THE BARBERINI IVORY</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="nind"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_315" id="page_315">{315}</a></span> equality with the Romans. Puppets wore the imperial purple and
did the behests of barbarian “Patricians,” Ricimer the Suevian,
Gundobald his nephew, and finally Odoacer, a tribeless barbarian from
the north. By this time the Western Empire was dismembered for ever, and
western Europe was merely a series of barbarian principalities. In 476
Odoacer removed the last puppet-emperor of Rome, who bore the
significant name of Romulus Augustulus. The seat of the Western Empire
had long been removed from the twice-sacked city of Rome, and the later
princes had ruled from Ravenna, where the little mausoleum of the
Empress Placidia, sister of Honorius, still stands as a type of the
shrunken glories of the last successors of Augustus.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>In theory the Western Empire did not come to an end in 476. The Eastern
emperors now claimed authority over the whole Roman world and exercised
it so far as they could obtain obedience. Strong Cæsars like Justinian
made their rule respected far and wide. Geographically and politically,
the West had now begun its mediæval existence as a congeries of small
kingdoms generally of uncertain extent.</p>

<p>But in a far truer sense Rome continued to rule the world as before. Her
two great legacies, the Roman Law and the Roman Church, ruled it as
completely as ever the legions had done. Even in politics, the grand
conception of the Christian Republic, Church and State in one, with the
Pope as the successor of St. Peter bearing the keys of Heaven and Hell,
while the emperor as the successor of Augustus wielded its sword,
continued for another thousand years to dominate Europe. It was under
the ægis of this great idea that the young nations grew up and came into
their own.</p>

<p>Thus the true history of Rome from this point is the history of the
Church, and this is no place to relate it. But it may be contended here
that the visible Church was as truly a creation of the Roman spirit as
was the Empire itself. Rome had seized upon the teaching of One who
lived in poverty<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_316" id="page_316">{316}</a></span> and obscurity among slaves and outcasts, who preached
against worldliness, formality, and ambition, who sent out His disciples
to beg their way, and out of this, with her wonderful genius for
government, she had created a powerful monarchy which could humble
kings, and an organised ecclesiastical state which spread like a network
over the earth and tamed the fury of the barbarians.</p>

<p>In the same way the culture of these latter days is to be found in
Church History. Augustine, St. John Chrysostom, and Tertullian are its
representative writers and thinkers more truly than Ausonius or
Claudian. Except for the Arch of Constantine,<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> which was mainly
compiled out of earlier remains, its Art is to be found in the sacred
mosaics of Constantinople or Torcello, or in the Byzantine ivories such
as the famous Barberini panel, showing Constantine as the establisher of
the Christian Faith.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> Architecture continues to show remarkable
developments, and in the wonderful palace which Diocletian constructed
for his retirement at Spalato on the Dalmatian coast there are new
combinations of the Roman arch with the Greek columns which are full of
promise for the birth of Gothic art.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> The earliest Christian churches
designed on the plan of a Greek cross, with a dome covering the
intersection of nave and transepts, is derived from Asia Minor and bears
traces of the oriental influence which is so powerful in Byzantine Art.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_317" id="page_317">{317}</a></span></p>

large mansion, and as suddenly comes back to it, finding as he does that
he is no better off abroad. He races to his country house, driving his

fire; he yawns the moment he has reached the door of his house, or sinks
heavily into sleep and seeks forgetfulness, or even in haste goes back

Matter is needed for after generations to grow, all of which, though,
will follow thee when they have finished their term of life; and thus it
is that all these no less than thou have before this come to an end and

contriving destruction for the fatherland, hurling his threats of fire
and slaughter against us and our city, we have cast him forth or driven
him forth or escorted him forth on his way with salutations. Gone,
vanished, absconded, escaped! No more shall disaster be plotted against
our bulwarks from within by that monster, that prodigy of wickedness. No

sirs, I would gladly give my body to death, if that could assure the
liberty of our country and help the pains o£ the Roman people to bring
the fruit of its long travailing to birth. Why, nearly twenty years ago
in this very temple I declared that death could not come too soon for a
man who had enjoyed a consulship. With how much more truth shall I
declare it in my age! To me death is already covetable; I have finished
with those rewards which I have gained and those honours which I have
achieved. Only these two prayers I make: one, that at my death I may
leave the Roman people free (than this nothing greater could be granted
by the immortal gods), and, secondly, that every man may so be requited
as he may deserve at the hands of the republic!</p></div>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
